0,Stakeholder involvement in climate assessment: bridging the gap between scientific research and the public,O'Connor et al.,2000-01-01,"Stakeholder participation is a crucial component of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Assessment (MARA) of Possible Consequences of Climate Variability and Change. We involved stakeholders for 6 reasons: to ensure that the assessment addresses stakeholder concerns, to enhance the technical quality of the assessment, to provide a forum for stakeholders with diverse constituencies to share ideas, to facilitate dissemination of assessment findings, to sensitize stakeholders to possible impacts as well as adaptation strategies, and to legitimize the process to third parties. The key means for involvement is an Advisory Committee that represents a myriad of experiences and perspectives, including members from mining companies, non-governmental voluntary organizations, and government as well as researchers. In the first phase members attended workshops and, approximately bimonthly, received (via e-mail, fax, or regular mail) updates on the MARA team's progress, with a request for feedback on items such as work plans for specific topics (e.g.. forestry, coastal zones), outlines of working group reports, draft scenarios that would serve as the basis for assessing impacts, or early materials for the draft preliminary report. Stakeholder involvement affected the focus of the assessment and the quality of the report. Stakeholders modified the MARA focus to include concerns that might have been ignored and improved the technical analysis of possible impacts.",10.3354/cr014255,Climate Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
1,Children with disabilities: A longitudinal study of child development and parent well-being - Introduction,Hauser-Cram et al.,2001-01-01,"The development of children with disabilities and the adaptation of their families present an array of challenges to researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and parents. For some, the diverse developmental pathways followed by children with disabilities provide important opportunities to expand our knowledge about human variation. For others, the diagnosis of an impairment calls for the formulation of an intervention strategy to promote more positive outcomes. Central to both is the need for greater understanding of how children with disabilities and their families change over time, and why some do better than others. The Early Intervention Collaborative Study (EICS) was initiated in 1985 to address these complex and compelling issues. The EICS is an ongoing, nonexperimental, longitudinal investigation designed originally to address three interrelated goals: (a) to analyze individual differences in the development of children with disabilities and in the adaptation of their families over time, (b) to generate related conceptual models of child and family development that integrate research on children with and without special needs, and (c) to contribute to the knowledge base that informs social policy and the delivery of intervention services. From its onset, the design of the study has been guided by models of human development that are ecological, contextual, and transactional (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Lerner, 1996; Sameroff & Chandler, 1975) and by an interest in the concepts of vulnerability and resilience (Rutter, 2000; Werner, 2000). The first phase of the investigation, which was described in a previous SRCD Monograph (Shonkoff, Hauser-Cram, Krauss, & Upshur, 1992), focused on the development of 190 infants and their parents during their initial year of participation in a community-based early intervention program. The findings presented in this second Monograph were generated from the continuing sample of 183 participants who were assessed at five points in time, from their entry into an early intervention program during the infant or toddler years through the child's 10th birthday. This investigation represents the largest and longest running study of children with a range of developmental disabilities and their parents ever undertaken in the United States. The richness and the longitudinal nature of these data provide a wealth of opportunities to analyze the interactive nature of child and family adaptation and, most important, to study developmental change over time. The findings presented in this Monograph can be used to inform both theory and practice. In the process of bridging these two domains, the study builds on two complementary historical contexts and addresses two converging agendas for the future.",10.1111/1540-5834.00151,Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
2,Fair adaptation to climate change,Paavola and Adger,2006-01-01,"This article identifies social justice dilemmas associated with the necessity to adapt to climate change, examines how they are currently addressed by the climate change regime, and proposes solutions to overcome prevailing gaps and ambiguities. We argue that the key justice dilemmas of adaptation include responsibility for climate change impacts, the level and burden sharing of assistance to vulnerable countries for adaptation, distribution of assistance between recipient countries and adaptation measures, and fair participation in planning and making decisions on adaptation. We demonstrate how the climate change regime largely omits responsibility but makes a general commitment to assistance. However, the regime has so far failed to operationalise assistance and has made only minor progress towards eliminating obstacles for fair participation. We propose the adoption of four principles for fair adaptation in the climate change regime. These include avoiding dangerous climate change, forward-looking responsibility, putting the most vulnerable first and equal participation of all. We argue that a safe maximum standard of 400-500 ppm Of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and a carbon tax of $20-50 per carbon equivalent ton could provide the initial instruments for operationalising the principles.

No general water scarcity is expected for the region even under unusually dry weather scenarios. Localized quantity and quality problems are likely to occur especially in groundwater recharge areas. Some existing institutions can be relied on by municipalities to build an effective adaptation strategy based on a watershed/region perspective, on their credibility, and on their expertise. Windows of opportunity or framing issues are offered at the provincial level, the most relevant one in a federal state, by municipal emergency plan requirements and pending watershed source water protection legislation.

4,Community capacity for adaptation to climate-induced water shortages: Linking institutional complexity and local actors,Ivey et al.,2004-01-01,"There is growing concern for the capacity of urban and rural communities to manage current water shortages and to prepare for shortages that may accompany predicted changes in climate. In this paper, concepts relating to the notion of climate adaptation and particularly ""capacity building"" are used to elucidate several determinants of community-level capacity for water management. These concepts and criteria are then used to interpret empirically derived insights relating to local management of water shortages in Ontario, Canada. General determinants of water-related community capacity relate to upper tier political and institutional arrangements; the characteristics of, and relationships among, pertinent agencies, groups, or individuals involved in water management; and the adequacy of financial, human, information, and technical resources. The case analysis illustrates how general factors play out in local experience. The findings point to geographically specific factors that influence the effectiveness of management. Key factors include collaboration between water managers, clarification of agency roles and responsibilities, integration of water management and land-use planning, and recognition and participation of both urban and rural stakeholders, whose sensitivities to water shortages are spatially and temporally variable.",10.1007/s00267-003-0014-5,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
5,"Responding to the coffee crisis: a pilot study of farmers' adaptations in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras",Eakin et al.,2006-01-01,"This article explores the impacts of market shocks and institutional change on smallholder livelihoods, and the challenge of adaptation in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. The rapid decline in coffee prices since the dissolution of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989 has had widespread and profound impacts across coffee-producing regions. The data collected in the three case studies of this project confirm the severity of the impact, particularly in the Mexican and Guatemalan communities. They also illustrate the importance of the historical relationship between farmers and public institutions in defining farmers' perception of risk, their awareness of the nature of the changes they face, and thus the flexibility of their responses to present and future uncertainty. The project's findings indicate that the existence and development of local networks among farmers, service providers and information sources may be critical for facilitating adaptation, particularly in the context of economic liberalization and globalized agriculture.",10.1111/j.1475-4959.2006.00195.x,Geographical Journal,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
6,Investigating the potential role of visualization techniques in participatory coastal management,Jude,2008-01-01,"The current shift toward soft forms of coastal defense as means of adapting to future sea level rise requires careful communication and consultation if they are to gain widespread public acceptance. For this to be achieved then coastal managers must improve the manner in which they communicate with stakeholders and members of the public. One possible solution may be through the application of landscape visualization techniques to illustrate how new policies or management interventions may shape the coast. This article investigates the potential role of such methods in participatory coastal management. Using interviews with coastal managers, the potential application of visualization techniques in coastal management processes are explored in detail. The findings suggest that while a number of possible roles for visualization techniques exist, there is an urgent need for practical testing and evaluation of the technology in participatory decision-making processes.",10.1080/08920750802266346,Coastal Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
7,"Livelihoods, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in Morogoro, Tanzania",Paavola,2008-01-01,"This article examines farmers' livelihood responses and vulnerability to climate variability and other stressors in Morogoro, Tanzania, to understand their implications for adaptation to climate change by agricultural households in developing world more generally. In Morogoro, agricultural households have extended cultivation, intensified agriculture, diversified livelihoods and migrated to gain access to land, markets and employment as a response to climatic and other stressors. Some of these responses have depleted and degraded natural resources such as forest, soil and water resources, which will complicate their living with climate change in the future. This will be particularly problematic to vulnerable groups such as women, children and pastoralists who have limited access to employment, markets and public services. In this light, fair adaptation to climate change by agricultural households in Morogoro and elsewhere in developing countries requires several complementary responses. Adaptation efforts should involve effective governance of natural resources because they function as safety nets to vulnerable groups. In addition, strengthening of national markets by infrastructure investments and institutional reforms is needed to give incentives to intensification and diversification in agriculture. Market participation also demands enhancement of human capital by public programs on health, education and wellbeing. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Effectively preparing for and responding to current and projected climate change requires ongoing assessment and action, not a one-time assessment of risks and interventions. To promote resilience to climate change and other community stressors, a stepwise course of action is proposed for community-based adaptation that engages stakeholders in a proactive problem solving process to enhance social capital across local and national levels. In addition to grassroots actions undertaken at the community level, reducing vulnerability to current and projected climate change will require top-down interventions implemented by public health organizations and agencies.",10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.018,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
9,Public health vulnerability to climate change in Brazil,Confalonieri et al.,2009-01-01,"A national quantitative assessment of the current vulnerability of the Brazilian population to the health impacts of climate change was undertaken with the support of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology. A conceptual framework of vulnerability in the health sector, according to a modified general 'exposure-response' model, was adopted (Confalonieri 2003). For the quantification of vulnerability, a new methodology was used to develop a synthetic (composite) general vulnerability index from averages of specific indices of vulnerability in 3 areas: socio-economic, epidemiological and climatological. We found that the greatest influence on the general vulnerability index (of the most vulnerable states) was from the socio-economic vulnerability index. The approach used also demonstrated that the northeast is the most vulnerable Brazilian region to the health impacts of a changing climate.",10.3354/cr00808,Climate Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
10,Developing an approach for tourism climate change assessment: evidence from four contrasting Australian case studies,Turton et al.,2010-01-01,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Australia as among the developed nations most at risk from climate change effects. Key tourism icon destinations and the tourism sector generally have been identified as being particularly at risk. This paper reports on an interdisciplinary, multi-case study approach to assess tourism stakeholders' knowledge of, and approaches to, climate change adaptation and to explore the potential for building a self-assessment toolkit that can be exported to other tourism destinations. This study examined existing knowledge on anticipated biophysical changes and, through primary research (stakeholder interviews and social learning workshops), gauged the expected adaptive approaches of destination communities and the tourism sector to these changes for 2020, 2050 and 2070. The facilitated workshops generated a common set of adaptation strategies across a diverse set of tourist destinations. A key finding from the workshops is that the tourism sector is not yet ready to invest in climate change adaptation because of the perceived uncertainties. Ongoing leadership for such measures were seen to rest with the public sector, especially local authorities. Whether such assessments can be self-generated or require specialist facilitation remains open to debate.",10.1080/09669581003639814,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
11,"Climate change, carbon prices and insurance systems",Phelan et al.,2010-01-01,"Market approaches to limit CO2e emissions such as carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes (ETSs) aim to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change by ascribing a financial cost to emissions. Yet such approaches have failed to establish either emissions limits or carbon prices equal to the task. We propose an approach to carbon pricing that better reflects the biogeophysical limits of the Earth system by drawing on aspects of insurance systems including forms of social insurance and the insurance industry. Our proposal achieves this by: (i) creating a financial liability link between current emissions and attributable near future losses; and (ii) applying Fraction Attributable Risk (FAR) analysis to determine the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to increased probability of experienced damaging weather events. Our proposal, a departure from current approaches to pricing CO2e emissions, has aspects that are consistent with existing forms of insurance. It requires participation by states and a small number of larger and established reinsurers. Our proposal provides both the scientific-technical capacity and the political-economic incentive to shift the anchor point for carbon prices away from pressing short-term political and economic considerations and closer to strategic ecological requirements for Earth system stability: the balance is shifted to favour changes in the global economy necessary to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change over current estimations of what is politically and economically feasible or desirable. Our proposal is an example of reflexive mitigation, grounded in complex adaptive systems theory, and centres on relationships between the Earth system, the global economy and insurance systems.",10.1080/13504500903541806,International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
12,Local institutions for floodplain management in Bangladesh and the influence of the Flood Action Plan,Sultana and Thompson,2010-01-01,"Institutional arrangements are a key issue for sustainable natural resource management. Recent water and fisheries management projects in Bangladesh have established new local institutions for floodplain management based on community organizations. Although the Flood Action Plan (FAP) was the culmination of an earlier emphasis on technical and structural 'solutions' to managing floods and water in Bangladesh, the expected large engineering works were never built. One legacy of FAP lies in a contested process that accelerated emphasis on public participation, smaller scale hazard adjustments and maintaining a wider range of floodplain resource values including conserving and restoring fisheries. This paper compares institutional arrangements and outcomes in two fisheries and two water management projects taken up after FAR Local organizations appeared generally successful in sustaining themselves and continuing floodplain resource management. Facilitation, the extent of consensus among different stakeholders, and fit between institutional arrangements and scale of resource were all important influences on effectiveness. Local organizations have sustained in smaller floodplains, but in larger areas co-management bodies were a key to effective coordination and troubleshooting among a series of linked community organizations. Local leaders tend to dominate after projects end, especially where planning was less participatory and organizational structures were determined from above. Participants stressed that for continued success formally recognized well-run organizations are needed with accountable and adaptable decision-making processes and good leaders. This process built on participatory guidelines from FAP but the local institutions have not addressed hazard risks. Community resource management institutions could develop a more integrated approach that internalizes the interactions between water, land and fishery management. So far, local planning for floods has been a notable gap in the activities of community institutions, but the enhanced social capital could be a basis for adaptation to climate change. For this, an enabling policy environment is needed, which could be facilitated by the open high-profile debate on floodplain issues that characterized FAP.",10.3763/ehaz.2010.SI05,Environmental Hazards-Human and Policy Dimensions,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
13,A Europe-South America network for climate change assessment and impact studies,Boulanger et al.,2010-01-01,"The goal of the CLARIS project was to build an integrated European-South American network dedicated to promote common research strategies to observe and predict climate changes and their consequent socio-economic impacts taking into account the climate and societal peculiarities of South America. Reaching that goal placed the present network as a privileged advisor to contribute to the design of adaptation strategies in a region strongly affected by and dependent on climate variability (e. g. agriculture, health, hydro-electricity). Building the CLARIS network required fulfilling the following three objectives: (1) The first objective of CLARIS was to set up and favour the technical transfer and expertise in earth system and regional climate modelling between Europe and South America together with the providing of a list of climate data (observed and simulated) required for model validations; (2) The second objective of CLARIS was to facilitate the exchange of observed and simulated climate data between the climate research groups and to create a South American high-quality climate database for studies in extreme events and long-term climate trends; (3) Finally, the third objective of CLARIS was to strengthen the communication between climate researchers and stakeholders, and to demonstrate the feasibility of using climate information in the decision-making process.",10.1007/s10584-009-9734-8,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

15,"Energy, Forest, and Indoor Air Pollution Models for Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone, Nepal Implementation of a Participatory Modeling Framework",Salerno et al.,2010-01-01,"This paper presents the results of management-oriented research on energy, forest, and human health issues in a remote mountain area, the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ), Nepal. The research was based on a broader, integrated participatory framework ultimately intended for use in adaptive management. The present study focused on the application of a participatory modeling framework to address problems related to energy demand and consumption, forest condition, and indoor air pollution, which were defined by the stakeholders as important issues to be addressed. The models were developed using a generalizing design that allows for user-friendly adaptation to other contexts (free download at http://hkkhpartnership.org). Moreover, we simulated management scenarios in collaboration with all modeling actors with the aim of building consensus on the understanding of the system as well as supporting decision-makers' capacity not only to respond to changes, but also to anticipate them. Importantly, the system dynamics assessment found that the SNPBZ forests are affected by an increasing demand for fuelwood (occurring due to tourism growth), as one of the main sources of energy. Selected forests show an average reduction of 38% in forest biomass from 1992 to 2008. This shows that the business-as-usual scenario is unlikely to result in the preservation of the current forest status; in fact, such preservation would require 75% of fuelwood to be replaced with alternative energy sources. At the same time, a 75% reduction of fuelwood use (and an 80% reduction of dung use) would reduce indoor carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations to the standard limits for CO exposure set by the World Health Organization.",10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-10-00027.1,Mountain Research and Development,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
16,Does public policy support or undermine climate change adaptation? Exploring policy interplay across different scales of governance,Urwin and Jordan,2008-01-01,"Policy makers have now recognised the need to integrate thinking about climate change into all areas of public policy making. However, the discussion of 'climate policy integration' has tended to focus on mitigation decisions mostly taken at international and national levels. Clearly, there is also a more locally focused adaptation dimension to climate policy integration, which has not been adequately explored by academics or policy makers. Drawing on a case study of the UK, this paper adopts both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective to explore how far different sub-elements of policies within the agriculture, nature conservation and water sectors support or undermine potential adaptive responses. The top-down approach, which assumes that policies set explicit aims and objectives that are directly translated into action on the ground, combines a content analysis of policy documents with interviews with policy makers. The bottom-up approach recognises the importance of other actors in shaping policy implementation and involves interviews with actors in organisations within the three sectors. This paper reveals that neither approach offers a complete picture of the potentially enabling or constraining effects of different policies on future adaptive planning, but together they offer new perspectives on climate policy integration. These findings inform a discussion on how to implement climate policy integration, including auditing existing policies and 'climate proofing' new ones so they support rather than hinder adaptive planning.

17,Potential synergy between adaptation and mitigation strategies: production of vegetable oils and biodiesel in northeastern Brazil,La Rovere et al.,2009-01-01,"In this study we discuss the potential of integrated adaptation and mitigation strategies to addess problems arising from climate change. This 'Ad-Mit' or 'Mit-Ad' approach is illustrated through the case of crop diversification by family farmers to crops used for vegetable oil and biodiesel production in the northeastern semi-arid region of Brazil. Impact assessments of some climate change scenarios indicate this region to be one of the most vulnerable in the country. Small farmers from the northeastern semi-arid region are among the low-income social groups most vulnerable to climate change. Improvement of the social and economic conditions in these rural communities through the growth of vegetable oil crops is an important adaptation strategy vis-a-vis future climate change, constituting an income-generation activity in the biodiesel production chain. The use of vegetable oils as a feedstock for biodiesel production and fuel reduces CO2 emissions due to the displacement of diesel oil, thus it also contributes to a mitigation strategy. Potential barriers to an increase in vegetable oil production by small farmers in the region are identified, including capacity building and logistics requirements. We discuss public policies and measures that could help overcome these barriers in the northeastern semi-arid region, and suggest the following: the use of selected seeds of several vegetable oil crops alongside subsistence crops, capacity building and technological and financial support to small farmers, and the building of logistics infrastructure and the appropriate institutional setting.",10.3354/cr00815,Climate Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
18,Climate change and Ontario forests: Prospects for building institutional adaptive capacity,Brown,2009-01-01,"Institutions play an important role in the adaptive capacity of a system in responding to climate change. This review paper characterizes the status of the collective institutional response (government, industry, First Nation, community, civil society) to climate change in the forest sector of the Canadian province of Ontario, and highlights the presence and nature of inter-institutional networks as part of the response. Based on a synthesis of the commonalities in the public administration and policy literature on tackling wicked problems, and the resilience literature, inter-institutional networks, which foster exchange of different types of knowledge, are an important aspect of enhancing the adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems such as the forest sector. Based on a content analysis of publicly available documents and insights gained from representatives of government, community members and non-governmental organizations, mitigation and adaptations strategies are described. At the provincial level there have been some new innovations in inter-institutional networks, but expansion of the forest stakeholders involved in such networks would further enhance adaptive capacity. In particular, it is important to network with First Nations and other forest-dependent communities who have a heightened vulnerability to climate change. The presence of a collaborative capacity builder could foster the transfer, receipt and integration of knowledge across the networks, and ultimately build long-term collaborative problem-solving capacity in the Ontario forest sector.",10.1007/s11027-009-9183-8,Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Municipalities, however, are subject to a host of challenges and barriers to action, revealing the critical need for sophisticated participatory processes in support of municipal decision-making under conditions of considerable uncertainty. This paper examines a new process for envisioning local climate change futures, which uses an iterative, collaborative, multistakeholder approach to produce computer-generated 3-dimensional images of climate change futures in the flood-prone municipality of Delta, British Columbia, Canada. The process appeared to forge communicative partnerships, which may improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of the flood management and climate change response discourse in the municipality of Delta, and may lead to locally specific and integrated flood management and climate change response strategies. We concluded that, while an enabling context and normative pressures are clearly integral to effective action, so too is the type and mode of presentation of information about climate futures.",10.1111/j.1753-318X.2010.01062.x,Journal of Flood Risk Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
21,Seven tools for creating adaptive policies,Swanson et al.,2010-01-01,"Experience demonstrates that policies crafted to operate within a certain range of conditions are often faced with unexpected challenges outside of that range. The result is that many policies have unintended impacts and do not accomplish their goals. Adaptive policies are designed to function more effectively in complex, dynamic, and uncertain conditions. Based on over a dozen case studies on public policies relating to agriculture and water resources management in Canada and India, we conclude that there are seven tools policymakers should follow to create adaptive policies. Adaptive policies anticipate and plan for the array of conditions that lie ahead: (#1) using integrated and forward-looking analysis; (#2) monitoring key performance indicators to trigger built-in policy adjustments; (#3) undertaking formal policy review and continuous learning; and (#4) using multi-stakeholder deliberation. But not all situations can be anticipated. Unknown unknowns and deep uncertainty will always be part of policymaking. Adaptive policies are able to navigate toward successful outcomes in settings that cannot be anticipated in advance. This can be done by working in concert with certain characteristics of complex adaptive systems and thereby facilitating autonomous actions among stakeholders on the ground. To a degree, adaptive policy tools #3 and #4 can be used toward this purpose, but most directly, such autonomous tools include: (#5) enabling self-organization and social networking; (#6) decentralizing decisionmaking to the lowest and most effective jurisdictional level; and (#7) promoting variation in policy responses. This paper elaborates on these seven tools as a pragmatic guide for policymakers who find themselves working in highly complex, dynamic, and uncertain settings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

22,"Taking a second look: climate change, periodic relicensing and improved management of dams",Pittock and Hartmann,2011-01-01,"Dams affect rivers and other freshwater ecosystems around the world. The structural performance and service delivery of many dams has seldom been assessed; many are unsafe and no longer deliver designed benefits. Changes in hydrology from climate change will require assessment of safety and operations of infrastructure. This creates an opportunity during relicensing for modification or removal of dams to render them safe, maximise their services and minimise social and environmental impacts. We examined case studies of reassessment of dams from Australia (New South Wales), China, France and the United States that illustrated the following: the management challenge of aging and unsafe dams; unrealised opportunities to improve environmental, social and economic benefits; and the benefits of inventory and relicensing systems. Key elements of an ideal regulatory system to optimise water infrastructure performance are identified, comprising periodic (time-limited) relicensing of all infrastructure overseen by an independent regulatory agency that would take decisions in the public interest through a transparent process, involving public participation. Each dam would have an identified owner who must apply best-available technologies to maximise safety, socioeconomic and environmental performance. Dam renovation could minimise current non-climate impacts, improve migration of aquatic wildlife and even attenuate some climate impacts on freshwater biota.",10.1071/MF09302,Marine and Freshwater Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
23,Adaptation through insurance: lessons from the NFIP,Thomas and Leichenko,2011-01-01,"Purpose - Insurance is widely regarded as a key adaptation option for climate change. Yet, the experience of the insurance sector in dealing with climatic hazards, particularly flooding, has been highly varied. Drawing from the experience of the US National Flood Insurance Program (NFEP), the purpose of this paper is to identify opportunities and challenges associated with using insurance as an adaptation strategy for climate change. Design/methodology/approach - This article critically reviews the history and recent performance of the NFIP and considers lessons for climate change adaptation through insurance. Findings - The US NFIP offers government-subsidized flood insurance for firms and residences. Over its 40-year history, the NFIP has struggled with financial instability and low levels of public participation in the program. The experience of the NFIP offers several lessons regarding the viability of insurance as an adaptation strategy: increasing insurance premiums to account for new climatic risks may mean that a growing segment of the population is unable or unwilling to purchase insurance, absent some other form of subsidization; educating the public on levels of risk and promoting appropriate risk mitigation are highly effective means for reducing damages from current and emerging weather-related risks; and close public-private cooperation is likely to be needed to prevent withdrawal of private insurers from high-risk areas and to ensure that insurance coverage continues to be widely available. Originality/value - Examination of past experience with insurance as a mechanism for climate adaptation offers lessons and insights that can inform development of effective strategies to address climate change.",10.1108/17568691111153401,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
24,Public Sector Reform and Governance for Adaptation: Implications of New Public Management for Adaptive Capacity in Mexico and Norway,Eakin et al.,2011-01-01,"Although many governments are assuming the responsibility of initiating adaptation policy in relation to climate change, the compatibility of ""governance-for-adaptation"" with the current paradigms of public administration has generally been overlooked. Over the last several decades, countries around the globe have embraced variants of the philosophy of administration broadly called ""New Public Management"" (NPM) in an effort to improve administrative efficiencies and the provision of public services. Using evidence from a case study of reforms in the building sector in Norway, and a case study of water and flood risk management in central Mexico, we analyze the implications of the adoption of the tenets of NPM for adaptive capacity. Our cases illustrate that some of the key attributes associated with governance for adaptation-namely, technical and financial capacities; institutional memory, learning and knowledge; and participation and accountability-have been eroded by NPM reforms. Despite improvements in specific operational tasks of the public sector in each case, we show that the success of NPM reforms presumes the existence of core elements of governance that have often been found lacking, including solid institutional frameworks and accountability. Our analysis illustrates the importance of considering both longer-term adaptive capacities and short-term efficiency goals in public sector administration reform.",10.1007/s00267-010-9605-0,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
25,Institutional traps and vulnerability to changes in climate and flood regimes in Thailand,Lebel et al.,2011-01-01,"Vulnerabilities to floods in Thailand are changing as a result of many factors. Formal and informal institutions help shape exposure, sensitivity and capacities to respond of individuals, social groups and social-ecological systems. In this paper we draw on several case studies of flood events and flood-affected communities to first assess how current practices reflect various laws, procedures, programs and policies for managing floods and disasters and then explore the implications for dealing with additional challenges posed by climate change. Our analysis identifies several institutional traps which need to be overcome if vulnerability is to be reduced, namely capture of agendas by technical elites, single-level or centralized concentration of capacities, organizational fragmentation and overemphasis on reactive crisis management. Possible responses are to expand public participation in managing risks, build adaptive capacities at multiple levels and link them, integrate flood disaster management and climate change adaptation into development planning, prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups and strengthen links between knowledge and practice. Responses like these could help reduce vulnerabilities under current climate and flood regimes, while also improving capacities to handle the future which every way that unfolds.",10.1007/s10113-010-0118-4,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
26,Contractual and Policy Challenges to Developing Ecocities,Gunawansa,2011-01-01,"Development of ecocities is one of the recent responses to climate change. What is envisaged in such developments is the creation of cities that are responsive to the surrounding environment in terms of pollution control, sustainable land use, mitigation of climate change and adaptation to changing climate conditions. Development of such cities from scratch or the conversion of existing cities into ecocities will be no easy task. The enormous financial and technological resources required for such developments may lead governments to rely on private sector participation in the development and management process of such cities. This paper argues that the concept of developing ecocities requires not only the successful completion of a project, but also the long-term maintenance of the sustainable features and their acceptance by the public. Thus, the paper points out that, in addition to the environmental sustainability concerns, the financial viability of the project, cultural considerations, community needs, capacity for future maintenance of the city and availability of a suitable regulatory and administrative framework for the administration of the city are important considerations. Further, the paper argues that the use of a traditional public-private-partnership (PPP) model of project development may not be a suitable vehicle for developing ecocities.

27,Informing regional level policy development and actions for increased adaptive capacity in rural livelihoods,Park et al.,2012-01-01,"Hazard impact assessments of vulnerability to climate change inherently fail to provide the context-specific understanding required to precipitate informed development of adaptation policies and actions. We demonstrate how this can occur by comparing a stakeholder participatory approach to assessing rural livelihood vulnerability across Pacific Island countries, with a widely used non-contextual approach, the Environmental Vulnerability Climate Change sub-index. The participatory approach was conducted in collaboration with a group of regional Pacific representatives. The approach included three activities: (i) producing a shared vision of the characteristics of vulnerability, (ii) estimating the relative vulnerability and capacity to adapt of Pacific Island communities using the Sustainable Livelihoods conceptual framework, and (iii) producing a post-hoc perspective of desirable policy-relevant outcomes to enhance adaptive capacity using Public Values Mapping analysis. The comparison of outputs derived from the two vulnerability assessment methods highlighted two notable differences: (i) different rankings of the vulnerability status of rural livelihoods in individual Pacific island countries, and (ii) differing capacities to support the delivery of action-orientated outputs and policy development. We argue that the participatory approach is more likely to result in effective policy outcomes, i.e. a reduction in the policy relevance gap and increased capacity to adapt. We substantiate this argument by attempting to create policy relevant outcomes from both vulnerability approaches. We show that the three-stage participatory approach is more able to satisfy the demand for decision-making processes relating to the allocation of climate change adaptation resources to be transparent and based on scientific evidence, as well as delivering outcomes that are in the public's interest. Output from the Environmental Vulnerability Climate Change sub-index was considered inadequate to effectively inform the development of policies and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability in rural livelihoods.

28,"Stakeholder perspectives on land-use strategies for adapting to climate-change-enhanced coastal hazards: Sarasota, Florida",Frazier et al.,2010-01-01,"Sustainable land-use planning requires decision makers to balance community growth with resilience to natural hazards. This balance is especially difficult in many coastal communities where planners must grapple with significant growth projections, the persistent threat of extreme events (e.g., hurricanes), and climate-change-driven sea level rise that not only presents a chronic hazard but also alters the spatial extent of sudden-onset hazards such as hurricanes. We examine these stressors on coastal, long-term land-use planning by reporting the results of a one-day community workshop held in Sarasota County, Florida that included focus groups and participatory mapping exercises. Workshop participants reflected various political agendas and socioeconomic interests of five local knowledge domains: business, environment, emergency management and infrastructure, government, and planning. Through a series of alternating domain-specific focus groups and interactive plenary sessions, participants compared the county 2050 comprehensive land-use plan to maps of contemporary hurricane storm-surge hazard zones and projected storm-surge hazard zones enlarged by sea level rise scenarios. This interactive, collaborative approach provided each group of domain experts the opportunity to combine geographically-specific, scientific knowledge on natural hazards and climate change with local viewpoints and concerns. Despite different agendas, interests, and proposed adaptation strategies, there was common agreement among participants for the need to increase community resilience to contemporary hurricane storm-surge hazards and to explore adaptation strategies to combat the projected, enlarged storm-surge hazard zones.

29,Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable development planning for Lijiang City,Xiao et al.,2011-01-01,"Cities are facing considerable challenges resulting from imminent climate change impacts. Urban planning to minimise adverse impacts of climate change at the city level can establish a climate-resilient city. Mitigation strategies to reduce CO(2) emissions would lead to a climate-friendly city. Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable city planning should not be merely added as a single level of sustainable city planning, but requires a wide range of multi-level cooperation. Lijiang City has experienced climatic change during the last half century, and its CO(2) emissions have increased faster than the GDP growth. Nearby glaciers on Yulong Snow Mountain have been retreating and losing mass since the early twentieth century. In this paper, we identify economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate change, including tourism, agriculture and water supply, and propose mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in this tourism city. As energy use is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy has enormous CO(2) reduction potential. Land use practices, a sectoral approach and public participation are all considered adaptive in climate planning. The proposals outlined are valuable as they provide an understanding of how to implement integrated climate planning and integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation into sustainable city planning.",10.1080/13504509.2011.603761,International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Using survey data from the Southern Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia, we present a method for identifying perceived landscape values and climate change risks to describe and quantify their spatial associations. Two spatial data models-vector and raster-and two analytical methods-Jaccard coefficients and spatial cross-correlations were used to describe the spatial associations. Results indicate that perceptions of climate change risk are driven, in part, by the values people assign or hold for places on the landscape. Biodiversity and intrinsic landscape values have strong spatial association with biodiversity loss risk while recreation values have strong spatial association with riparian flooding, sea-level rise and wave action risks. Other landscape values show weak to no spatial association with perceived climate change risks. The methodology described in this research provides a mechanism for government agencies to develop place-based adaptation strategies based on these associations.",10.1007/s10584-010-9806-9,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The study was conducted in Iqaluit, Nunavut, using a participatory action approach and the photovoice research method. Participants identified themes and patterns in the data and developed a visual model of the relationships between the themes identified. Five themes emerged from the data: the direct impacts of climate change on the health of individuals and communities, the transition from past climates to future climates, necessary adaptation to the changing climate in the North, the call to action (individual, regional, and national), and reflection on the past and changing knowledge systems. A climate change and health model was developed to illustrate the relationships between the themes. Participants in this study conceptualized health and climate change broadly. Participants believed that by engaging in a process of ongoing reflection, and by continually incorporating new knowledge and experiences into traditional knowledge systems, communities may be better able to adapt and cope with the challenges to health posed by climate change.",10.14430/arctic4082,Arctic,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
32,Forest ecohydrological research in the 21st century: what are the critical needs?,Vose et al.,2011-01-01,"Modern ecohydrologic science will be critical for providing the best information to policy makers and society to address water resource challenges in the 21st century. Implicitly, ecohydrology involves understanding both the functional interactions among vegetation, soils, and hydrologic processes at multiple scales and the linkages among upland, riparian, and aquatic components. In this paper, we review historical and contemporary ecohydrologic science, focusing on watershed structure and function and the threats to watershed structure and function. Climate change, land use change, and invasive species are among the most critical contemporary issues that affect water quantity and quality, and a mechanistic understanding of watershed ecosystem structure and function is required to understand their impacts on water quantity and quality. Economic and social values of ecosystem services such as water supply from forested watersheds must be quantified in future research, as land use decisions that impact ecohydrologic function are driven by the interplay among economic, social, political, and biological constraints. Future forest ecohydrological research should focus on: (1) understanding watershed responses to climate change and variability, (2) understanding watershed responses to losses of native species or additions of non-native species, (3) developing integrated models that capitalize on long-term data, (4) linking ecohydrologic processes across scales, and (5) managing forested watersheds to adapt to climate change. We stress that this new ecohydrology research must also be integrated with socio-economic disciplines. Published in 2011.

33,Preventing Disasters: Public Health Vulnerability Reduction as a Sustainable Adaptation to Climate Change,Keim,2011-01-01,"Global warming could increase the number and severity of extreme weather events. These events are often known to result in public health disasters, but we can lessen the effects of these disasters. By addressing the factors that cause changes in climate, we can mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the factors that make society vulnerable to the effects of climate, we can adapt to climate change. To adapt to climate change, a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction has been proposed. By reducing human vulnerability to disasters, we can lessen-and at times even prevent-their impact. Human vulnerability is a complex phenomenon that comprises social, economic, health, and cultural factors. Because public health is uniquely placed at the community level, it has the opportunity to lessen human vulnerability to climate-related disasters. At the national and international level, a supportive policy environment can enable local adaptation to disaster events. The purpose of this article is to introduce the basic concept of disaster risk reduction so that it can be applied to preventing and mitigating the negative effects of climate change and to examine the role of community-focused public health as a means for lessening human vulnerability and, as a result, the overall risk of climate-related disasters.

34,Sustainability of pasture-based livestock farming systems in the European Mediterranean context: Synergies and trade-offs,Bernues et al.,2011-01-01,"The sustainability of livestock farming systems (LFS) in relation to global concerns about climate change, population dynamics and the quality of the agro-ecosystem services that are provided to society and their trade-offs has become a fundamental issue for public and scientific debate. However. LFS differ widely in terms of the use of resources, degree of intensification, species and orientation of production, local/regional socio-economic and market context, cultural roles, etc. Therefore, we need to disaggregate livestock farming systems when analysing any aspect of sustainability. This paper discusses low-input pasture-based farming systems (meat sheep and beef cattle) located in mountainous and other less favoured areas of the European Mediterranean basin. We first describe their recent evolution in terms of the level of intensification and structural, economic, social and environmental factors at the farm level, paying special attention to critical points of sustainability. Despite the diversity encountered, there are some common factors that threaten their future, such as an excessive dependency on premiums, the lack of generational turnover due to a number of increasingly influential social factors and a continuous process of abandonment of large marginal areas and concentration in more favourable areas. Next, we depict some relevant synergies and trade-offs between a number of factors that we have previously described, taking into account the wider socio-economic environment in which farms operate. Pasture-based LFS can satisfy societal demands (for public goods such as landscape and biodiversity or ethical concerns about food production) and are less vulnerable to market changes. However, they are not paid for the environmental services they deliver, they suffer displacement by other economic activities, and they are very sensitive to climate change scenarios. We also point out a number of options for designing and implementing more sustainable pasture-based LFS under very uncertain circumstances; the concepts of resilience, adaptive capacity and self-sufficiency are discussed within this context. Finally, we summarise some areas for future research: -valuation and integration of positive externalities of pasture-based LFS in an analytical sustainability frameworks and management tools, -assessment of the diversity of systems, the impact they generate and the public goods they deliver, -analysis of complex relationships between intensification of production, dependence on off-farm/on-farm inputs, productivity and working conditions, -consideration of the social factors that determine continuity and working conditions, -and the necessity of performing dynamic studies that allow the understanding and anticipation of change.

Many countries have adopted the inter-agency coordination mechanism (IACM) as a national institutional approach to adjust the functions of various governmental agencies to tackle climate change. This article compares and contrasts national IACMs in four countries: Japan, the Republic of Korea, China and India. It examines (1) the structure and function of an IACM; (2) agencies and their specific roles in IACMs; (3) measures to empower the participation of other stakeholders including local governments, private sector, civil society and academia; and (4) changes in IACMs and reasons for such changes. Four success factors drawn from our comparative study suggest that an effective IACM should feature (1) strong overall coordination by the President/Prime Minister; (2) empowerment of the industry and environment agencies as joint lead agencies coordinating mitigation and adaptation; (3) involvement of all major sectoral agencies related to mitigation and adaptation; and (4) maximisation of the use of the comparative advantages of other stakeholders.

The property development 'industry' consists of diverse private actors with considerable financial, political or technical resources. However, there is no empirical research to date on the potential contribution of these actors, and particularly property developers, to climate adaptation, in terms of their preferences, capabilities and perceptions. This article reports on findings from a survey of, and discussions with, Australian property developers, their representative industry bodies, and technical and advisory service providers to developers. Amongst other themes, we focus here on: participation and capacity; effectiveness of current polices; risks and opportunities; and cost-sharing considerations as perceived by these groups. Results indicate that developers and their interest groups are seeking greater levels of participation and joint decision-making in public-adaptation policy and its implementation. The results also suggest that while developers and their service providers recognise a shift towards greater levels of responsibility and cost sharing for adaptation, perceptions of operational ambiguities and financial risks hinder progress in this area. Given this, the authors point to the need to further examine the potential of new deliberative arenas that can balance and complement existing regulatory controls in the governance of urban adaptation.",10.1080/08111146.2011.639178,Urban Policy and Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
37,Using Participatory Scenarios to Stimulate Social Learning for Collaborative Sustainable Development,Johnson et al.,2012-01-01,"Interdependent human and biophysical systems are highly complex and behave in unpredictable and uncontrollable ways. Social and ecological challenges that emerge from this complexity often defy straightforward solutions, and efforts to address these problems will require not only scientific and technological capabilities but also learning and adaptation. Scenarios are a useful tool for grappling with the uncertainty and complexity of social-ecological challenges because they enable participants to build adaptive capacity through the contemplation of multiple future possibilities. Furthermore, scenarios provide a platform for social learning, which is critical to acting in the face of uncertain, complex, and conflict-laden problems. We studied the Minnesota 2050 project, a collaborative project through which citizens collectively imagined future scenarios and contemplated the implications of these possibilities for the adaptability of their social and environmental communities. Survey and interview data indicate that these participatory scenario workshops built and strengthened relationships, enhanced participants' understanding of other perspectives, and triggered systemic thinking, all of which is relevant to collective efforts to respond to social-ecological challenges through sustainable development activities. Our analysis shows that participatory scenarios can stimulate social learning by enabling participants to engage and to discuss options for coping with uncertainty through collaborative actions. Such learning can be of value to participants and to the organizations and decisions in which they are engaged, and scenario processes can be effective tools for supporting collaborative sustainable development efforts.",10.5751/ES-04780-170209,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

This paper takes stock of respective institutional innovations at the national level in 10 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It first introduces four challenges that are key in the context of climate adaptation policy-making, that is, (i) how to better integrate adaptation policies horizontally across policy sectors and (ii) vertically across jurisdictional levels, (iii) how to integrate knowledge, and (iv) how to involve non-state stakeholders in adaptation policy-making. Based on a desk research and semi-structured interviews, this paper then highlights a variety of institutional innovations (here referred to as governance approaches) that the selected governments employ to address these four challenges. Overall, it is shown that most of these approaches are restricted to soft, voluntary ways of coordination and steering that often address more than one of the four challenges at a time and that national adaptation strategies usually mark the centrepiece of adaptation governance around which other governance approaches emerge.",10.1080/1523908X.2012.707406,Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Populations around the world are ageing. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed initiatives to encourage cities and regions to become age-friendly for seniors. This work examines WHO's age-friendly domains in the context of a northern, winter city in Canada. The urban centre of Edmonton, Alberta experiences both a climate characterized by long, cold winters and a sprawling, built environment with very low population densities. The research found that seniors did report a difference in built environment preferences in summer and winter and that some of those preferences match the elements of the eight WHO domains. However two additional important findings also emerged. First, winter weather was the dominating concept for discussion of the environment regardless of the time of year, and these weather concerns conflated seniors' perceptions of publicprivate spaces, pointing to the need to carefully examine how this conflation might influence civic participation. Second, participants almost unanimously spoke to the need to make individual adaptations in order to navigate their environments as their mobility decreased. In other words, instead of expecting environmental adaptations to meet their changing needs, seniors accepted and individually managed to the best of their ability the ongoing challenges. These findings provide empirical results that can be used to develop supportive built environments in winter cities, with an emphasis on upstream health geography and public health imperatives that enable safe and vibrant neighbourhoods to support healthy aging, which has implications for geographers, planners, and public health personnel.",10.1111/geob.12004,Geografiska Annaler Series B-Human Geography,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

As a spatial ""scale"" of the assessment, Moldova's administrative-territorial units (ATUs) were selected. The exposure assessment was based on the climatic analysis of baseline (1971-2000) temperature and precipitation and projections of their changes in 2021-2050, separately for cold and warm periods. The sensitivity assessment included physiographical and socioeconomic characteristics, described by a set of specific indicators. The adaptive capacity was expressed by general economic and agricultural indicators, taking into consideration the medical provision and housing conditions. Through a ranking approach, the relative vulnerability of each ATU was calculated by summing its sensitivity and adaptive capacity ranks; the latter were obtained as combinations of their primary indicator ranks, arranged in an increasing and decreasing order, respectively. Due to lack of sound knowledge on these components' importance in overall assessment of vulnerability, their weights were taken as conventionally equal. Mapping of vulnerability revealed that ATUs neighboring to municipalities are the most vulnerable and need special attention in climate change adaptation. The basin's ""hotspots"" were discussed with public participation.",10.1155/2013/173794,Scientific World Journal,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
41,Adaptive capacity and regional water governance in north-western Germany,Grecksch,2013-01-01,"Successful adaptation to climate change requires flexible adaptation strategies which consider regional ecological, economic and social circumstances. Coastal zones are considered to be significantly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The projected impacts of climate change in the metropolitan region of Bremen-Oldenburg, Germany (a coastal area), are, for example, rising sea level, salt water intrusion, temporary groundwater scarcity in the summer and increased (heavy) rainfalls. This paper uses an existing framework, the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW), complemented by two additional dimensions: adaptation motivation and adaptation belief. The objectives were first, to assess the adaptive capacity of water governance in the study region, and second, to show how the ACW can be used as an approach and a communication tool with stakeholders to identify strengths and weaknesses. Based on this, a further objective was to discover what lessons and recommendations can be drawn that could help water experts and stakeholders in the future. The results show a high adaptive capacity and that the addition of the psychological dimensions was valuable. However, it is important to look closely at each dimension assessed by the ACW. The key recommendations are: to improve public participation; to ensure better coordination; to raise awareness; and to reduce the lack of political will to overcome adaptation barriers.",10.2166/wp.2013.124,Water Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are undertaken for three cities: Amman, Jakarta and Dar es Salaam, including determination of GHG emissions and analysis of climate change data (where available) for each. Findings - In Amman, the most climate-sensitive municipal service is water; Jordan is exceptionally dry, and nearly 15 per cent of all electricity consumption is by the water authority. Jakarta has already experienced extreme flooding. The climate vulnerabilities associated with sea-level rise are intensified by subsidence in parts of Jakarta. Alternating floods and droughts are climate impacts already experienced in Dar es Salaam. Droughts have impacted Tanzania's electricity infrastructure disrupting hydroelectricity production, requiring new natural gas infrastructure to maintain power, thereby increasing GHG emissions. Nonetheless, Dar es Salaam's GHG emissions at 0.56 t CO(2)e/cap are small compared to Amman and Jakarta at 3.66 and 4.92 t CO(2)e/cap., respectively. Originality/value - Synergist development strategies, addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation are suggested. In Amman an increased share of photovoltaic electricity production might be used for service provision, especially for energy needs surrounding water supply. Advanced slum upgrading in Jakarta could see relocation of the at-risk poor to safe areas with energy efficient homes connected to public transit and decentralized, community-based electricity generation. The focus in Dar es Salaam community-based waste-to-energy facilities would reduce climate change impacts and vulnerabilities while addressing energy poverty in poor communities.",10.1108/17568691311299381,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Three particular locations are the focus of CHANGE Changing Coasts, Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a 3-year study (2010-2013) that aims to understand social perceptions about coastal risks and to examine new ways of adaptive management. The project involved assessing peoples' representations about the coastal present and possible coastal futures and discussed coastal change with local populations, in a country in which the protection of vulnerable coast to date has had little public involvement. The three coastal stretches studied face increasing coastal risks and the perspective of reduced public spending, fuelling uncertainty about their future. Public participation in coastal management has been almost entirely absent, which makes the social science based contribution of this research even more relevant. This research combines: a) scientific assessments on the past and future evolution of the shoreline, taking into account the impacts of climate change; b) interviews with policy-makers, coastal experts and stakeholders, as well as local public opinion surveys; c) the outputs of a model for coastal governance and community building, based on local discussions through focus groups and workshops.

The workshops fostered cross-jurisdictional and multidisciplinary dialogue on climate change through active participation of scientists and managers in assessing climate change effects, discussing the implications of those effects for determining management goals and activities, and cultivating opportunities for regional coordination on adaptation of management plans. Facilitated application of the ACT framework advanced group discussions beyond assessing effects to devising options to mitigate the effects of climate change on specific species, ecological functions, and ecosystems. Participants addressed uncertainty about future conditions by considering more than one climate-change scenario. They outlined opportunities and identified next steps for implementing several actions, and local partnerships have begun implementing actions and conducting additional planning. Continued investment in adaptation of management plans and actions to address the effects of climate change in the southwestern United States and extension of the approaches used in this project to additional landscapes are needed if biological diversity and ecosystem services are to be maintained in a rapidly changing world.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01954.x,Conservation Biology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
45,Adapting governance for coastal change in Portugal,Schmidt et al.,2013-01-01,"In many countries, but particularly in Portugal, coastal conditions are already endangered by flooding and erosion, both likely to increase as a result of climate change. This daunting prospect raises critical questions of sustainability; social justice; genuine public participation and social learning; effective financing for long term social and economic benefit; connected polycentric governance; and the appropriate use of scientific knowledge bonded to public and political trust. While the development of most shorelines is nominally shaped by public administrative action, rapid coastal migration and excessive economic concentration have turned many threatened coastlines into a stage for settlement hazard and institutional chaos. In Portugal, despite clear evidence of increasing flooding and erosion, appropriate management responses are proving inadequate, both in the turbulent planning framework and in the scarce financial provision for future safeguard. The only plausible alternatives seem to lie in the processes of progressive adaptive governance, involving the trust and full participation of local communities; strongly supported scientific assessments of threat and safety; and fresh approaches to finding suitable funding sources. However, as evident from interviews with key actors in coastal planning in Portugal, the lack of policy clarity and political will, the weak science and poor coordination of stakeholders, combined with the particular regenerating coastal cultures of these communities, make any organised adaptive approaches highly problematic. This consequently places more emphasis on the rich cultural meanings of coastal occupation; of national identity in a time of economic crisis; of social justice in a period of reduced coastal maintenance funding; and of a more measured and sequential approach to an adaptive coastal governance.

46,"Economic assessment of climate adaptation options for urban drainage design in Odense, Denmark",Zhou et al.,2012-01-01,"Climate change is likely to influence the water cycle by changing the precipitation patterns, in some cases leading to increased occurrences of precipitation extremes. Urban landscapes are vulnerable to such changes due to the concentrated population and socio-economic values in cities. Feasible adaptation requires better flood risk quantification and assessment of appropriate adaptation actions in term of costs and benefits. This paper presents an economic assessment of three prevailing climate adaptation options for urban drainage design in a Danish case study, Odense. A risk-based evaluation framework is used to give detailed insights of the physical and economic feasibilities of each option. Estimation of marginal benefits of adaptation options are carried out through a step-by-step cost-benefit analysis. The results are aimed at providing important information for decision making on how best to adapt to urban pluvial flooding due to climate impacts in cities.",10.2166/wst.2012.386,Water Science and Technology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
47,Democratizing climate finance governance and the public funding of climate action,Schalatek,2012-01-01,"Addressing climate change - its causes, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and its worst impacts on some of the poorest countries and societal groups - requires many billions of dollars. A significant portion of short- and long-term finance will have to come from industrialized countries in the form of public money transferred to developing countries, for private sector investment and carbon markets are unlikely to be sufficient. This is not only an international treaty obligation of the historic polluter countries, but also a matter of upholding human rights. However, nothing less than the democratization of climate finance governance is needed. Democratic core principles such as accountability, transparency and public and gender-equitable participation in decision-making must guide the mobilization of public climate funding, and the governance and administration of these resources and their allocation to recipients. Citizens in contributing and recipient countries have a right and an obligation to be informed about and involved in how public money is utilized to address climate change. Only then will concrete mitigation and adaptation action be effective, efficient and equitable.",10.1080/13510347.2012.709690,Democratization,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
48,Addressing the Climate Change-Sustainable Development Nexus: The Role of Multistakeholder Partnerships,Pinkse and Kolk,2012-01-01,"While calls are being made to deal with the linkages between climate change and sustainable development to arrive at an integrated policy, concrete steps in this direction have been very limited so far. One of the possible instruments through which both issues may be approached simultaneously is a multistakeholder partnership, a form of governance with the potential to address existing regulatory, participation, resource and learning gaps as it harnesses the strengths of private, public, and nonprofit partners. There is some insight into partnerships for climate change, but largely limited to developed countries, and those in developing countries most often do not involve companies. To help fill this gap, this article explores the role of multistakeholder partnerships in addressing climate change and sustainable development in developing-country settings. It elaborates on the governance function of partnerships, on actor involvement, the gaps addressed, as well as synergies and trade-offs in the climate change-sustainable development nexus and how partnerships may help address them. As the number of such partnerships is still limited, we discuss seven illustrative partnerships and draw conclusions as to further conceptualizations and implications for research and practice.",10.1177/0007650311427426,Business & Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
49,The Potential Role for Management of U.S. Public Lands in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Climate Policy,Olander et al.,2012-01-01,"Management of forests, rangelands, and wetlands on public lands, including the restoration of degraded lands, has the potential to increase carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond what is occurring today. In this paper we discuss several policy options for increasing GHG mitigation on public lands. These range from an extension of current policy by generating supplemental mitigation on public lands in an effort to meet national emissions reduction goals, to full participation in an offsets market by allowing GHG mitigation on public lands to be sold as offsets either by the overseeing agency or by private contractors. To help place these policy options in context, we briefly review the literature on GHG mitigation and public lands to examine the potential for enhanced mitigation on federal and state public lands in the United States. This potential will be tempered by consideration of the tradeoffs with other uses of public lands, the needs for climate change adaptation, and the effects on other ecosystem services.",10.1007/s00267-011-9806-1,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
50,Building regional priorities in forests for development and adaptation to climate change in the Congo Basin,Sonwa et al.,2012-01-01,"Indentifying common priorities in shared natural resource systems constitutes an important platform for implementing adaptation and a major step in sharing a common responsibility in addressing climate change. Predominated by discourses on REDD + (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) with little emphasis on adaptation there is a risk of lack of policy measures in addressing climate change in the Congo Basin. Forest products and ecosystem services provide security portfolios for the predominantly rural communities, and play major roles in national development programmes in both revenue and employment opportunities. Thus, raising the profile of forests in the policy arena especially in the twin roles of addressing climate change in mitigation and adaptation and achieving resilient development is crucial. Within the framework of the Congo Basin Forests and Climate Change Adaptation project (COFCCA) project, science policy dialogue was conducted to identify and prioritize forest based sectors vulnerable to climate change but important to household livelihoods and national development. The goal of the prioritization process was for the development of intervention in forest as measures for climate change adaptation in Central Africa. Participants constituted a wide range of stakeholders (government, Non Governmental Organizations, research institutions, universities, community leaders, private sectors etc.) as representatives from three countries directly involved in the project: Cameroon, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo. Building on national priorities, four forest related sectors were identified as common priorities at the regional level for focus on climate change adaptation. These sectors included: (1) energy with emphasis on fuel wood and Charcoal; (2) Water principally quality, quantity, accessibility, etc.; (3) Food with emphasis on Non Timber Forest Products, and (4) Health linked to healthcare products (medicinal plants). Using these prioritized sectors, the project focused on addressing the impacts of climate change on local communities and the development of adaptation strategies in the three pilot countries of the Congo Basin region. The four sectors constitute the key for development in the region and equally considered as priority sectors in the poverty reduction papers. Focused research on these sectors can help to inject the role of forests in national and local development and their potentials contributions to climate change adaptation in national and public discourses. Mainstreaming forest for climate change adaptation into national development planning is the key to improve policy coherence and effectiveness in forest management in the region.",10.1007/s11027-011-9335-5,Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
51,Improving China's water resources management for better adaptation to climate change,Cheng and Hu,2012-01-01,"Challenged by insufficient water resources and by degraded water quality caused by widespread pollution, China faces an imbalance between the supply and the demand of water for supporting the rapid social and economic development while protecting the natural environment and ecosystems. Climate change is expected to further stress freshwater resources and widen the gap between the demand for and supply of water. As a legacy of the earlier planned economy, water resources management has been primarily supply-driven, which largely fails to account for the economic nature of water resources in relation to their natural characteristics. This paper presents a historical perspective on the water resources management policies and practices in China, and recommends demand management and pollution control as key measures for improving water resources management to adapt to climate change based on the current political, socio-economic and water resources conditions. The past and future impacts of climate change on water resources in China and the general adaptation strategies are also presented. How demand management through increasing water use efficiency, improving water rights and rights trade, and effective regulation enforcement, along with pollution control could improve China's water resources management are discussed in details. Ultimately, China should develop a sustainable water resources management strategy based on both supply- and demand-side management options to make the limited water supplies meet the demands of economic development, social well-being and the conservation of ecosystems in the context of global climate change.",10.1007/s10584-011-0042-8,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
52,Does individual responsibility increase the adaptive capacity of society? The case of local water management in the Netherlands,Bergsma et al.,2012-01-01,"In different parts of the world, neo-liberal politics is shifting responsibilities from the nation state to other governmental and non-governmental actors. This is also evident in the governance of adaptation to the impacts of climate change, where the responsibility of the individual is increasingly stressed. This paper focuses on institutions for local water management in the Netherlands and aims to explain how the institutional shift to individual responsibility affects the adaptive capacity of society to deal with the impacts of climate change. The paper uses a case study approach in which stakeholders are interviewed: the analysis is then structured along an 'Adaptive Capacity Wheel'. It concludes that the recent institutional shift creates different challenges for increasing the adaptive capacity, amongst others: a lack of clearly defined responsibilities and accountability procedures, scattered and not easily accessible information to individuals, an overlap in municipal and individual responsibility, and differences in social context that call for context-specific management approaches pose challenges to increasing the adaptive capacity. The paper also draws conclusions on the methodology used. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.03.006,Resources Conservation and Recycling,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
53,"Public perceptions of climate and cryosphere change in typical arid inland river areas of China: Facts, impacts and selections of adaptation measures",Deng et al.,2012-01-01,"As typical inland river basins in China, the Urumqi River Basin and the Aksu River Basin were selected as study areas in this paper. In the past several decades, the climate has had a tendency to change from warm-drying to warm-wetting, with a coinstantaneous response by mountain glacier meltwater of these areas. Comparing questionnaire survey data with scientific observation, this study focused on the character of public perception on climate and cryosphere changes, the changes' possible impacts on water resources, and adaptation measure choices by the public. Results presented in this study showed that: 1) Perceptions of most respondents on climate and cryosphere changes conform to objective facts, but some of them still have suspicion relating to these environmental changes; 2) Even though increasing precipitation and glacier meltwater has caused an increased water supply, due to the increasing demand of the unit area water for agriculture (industrial and living water demand may be involved), water shortage is still a big problem in sustainable development. Because of unemployment or the inconspicuous benefits of water-saving measures, the wasting of water resources may be a serious problem in these areas; 3) Most people preferred to choose the adaptation measures implemented by government and policy-making departments. Some people showed more preference for measures avoiding unfavorable natural environmental consequences. Public perceptions on the urgency of individual participation are still inadequate. Some of the measures should be communicated broadly and warmly encouraged; 4) Public choices of adaptation measures for climate and cryosphere change are impacted by demographic factors such as age, gender, region, nationality, education and occupation. The impacts of such factors are complicated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.quaint.2012.04.033,Quaternary International,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
54,Quantifying Household Water Demand: A Review of Theory and Practice in the UK,Parker and Wilby,2013-01-01,"Socio-economic change, severe droughts, and environmental concerns focus attention on sustainability of water supplies and the ability of water utilities to meet levels of service. Traditionally, water management has been supply-side dominated and long-term demand forecasting has received relatively little attention. However, it is increasingly recognised that water demand management could be a 'low regret' adaptation measure (both financially and environmentally) given large uncertainties about future non-climate and climate pressures. This paper begins with a brief history of household water demand management in the UK. We then review approaches to water demand estimation and forecasting over the short- (daily to season) and long-term (years to decade) and note the paucity of studies on weather and climate. We discuss peak household water use behaviours identified from metering trials, micro-component diary-based studies, and statistical techniques for long-term demand forecasting. We refer to the Anglian Water Services (AWS) 'Golden 100' data to illustrate the significant practical and conceptual issues faced when mining household water use data for weather signals, especially when the data are noisy and originally intended for other applications. Further research is needed into the relationships between climate variables and household micro-component water use, especially for peak demands.",10.1007/s11269-012-0190-2,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The default PAGE09 model gives a mean estimate of the social cost of CO2 (SCCO2) of $106 per tonne of CO2, compared to $81 from the PAGE2002 model used in the Stern review (Stern 2007). The increase is the net result of several improvements that have been incorporated into the PAGE09 model in response to the critical debate around the Stern review: the adoption of the A1B socio-economic scenario, rather than A2 whose population assumptions are now thought to be implausible; the use of ranges for the two components of the discount rate, rather than the single values used in the Stern review; a distribution for the climate sensitivity that is consistent with the latest estimates from IPCC 2007a; less adaptation than in PAGE2002, particularly in the economic sector, which was criticised for possibly being over-optimistic; and a more theoretically-justified basis of valuation that gives results appropriate to a representative agent from the focus region, the EU.

56,"Evaluating alternative forest management strategies for the Champagne and Aishihik Traditional Territory, southwest Yukon",Waeber et al.,2013-01-01,"Sustainable forest management (SFM) requires the balancing of diverse values and conflicting management objectives. Climate change adds a further degree of uncertainty to this complex issue. In this study we analysed a Strategic Forest Management Plan (SFMP) from the southwest Yukon, Canada. The SFMP was developed to enable the salvage harvesting of beetle-killed white spruce stands and encourage fuel-abatement treatments to reduce fire risk to local communities. It did not, however, provide a long-term strategy to achieve SFM in the region. In this study, the SFMP served as the basis to develop and evaluate alternative forest management strategies in the context of climate change. Working group discussions with local stakeholders enabled the structuring of a ratings table that helped practitioners and experts to characterize five alternative strategies stemming from the SFMP, based on its main goals and objectives. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AMP) was then used to balance competing values and objectives and test the alternatives against each other. The strategy 'Manage for multiple values and use' had the highest AHP-score when compared to the four other alternatives (timber, wildlife, fire risk reduction and carbon), which were narrower in scope. It may represent the best balance for the ecological and socio-economic values listed in the SFMP. Although the multiple values (MV) alternative is closest to the current SFMP in terms of scope, this study highlights that there are viable alternatives such as 'manage for wildlife' that achieved similar scores to the MV approach. The current SFMP has great potential to serve as a basis and starting point for a continuous and adaptive planning process for forest managenient Exploring the different/alternative strategic directions will help to better address uncertain futures, thereby leading to more sustainable approaches.

57,How effectively low carbon society development models contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation action plans in Asia,Ali et al.,2013-01-01,"Backcasting is not a new concept for scientists dealing with carbon mitigation or climate change mitigation issues around the world, but could be an innovative idea for public, local, and national policy planners as they are so far only familiar with forecast scenarios for different issues and sectors. Defining a roadmap to achieving low carbon targets and explaining these targets in quantitative form as much as possible is known as backcasting. Plenty of computer-based quantitative models and tools are used to outline low carbon society scenarios in the Asia-Pacific region and implementations of such models are underway. This paper spotlights these quantitative models and tools which are used to achieve backcasting benchmarks. These models are critically reviewed for their functioning and real possibilities on ground levels and suggestions have been made to improve practical implementation in developing Asia. The study found that all these models are highly acceptable and applicable in Asian countries but actual applications are rare, with Japan as the leading country in implementing such applications, followed by Malaysia. Estimation of CO2 sinks, open availability, and energy service demands (built-in option) are major weaknesses of the models. We also concluded that these computer-based quantitative models are helpful for almost all of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region facing such issues as data limitation, fewer resources, and lack of government participation.

By 2050 it is estimated that 70% of the world's population will live in cities. The critical challenge for contemporary urbanism, therefore, is to understand how to develop the knowledge, capacity and capability for public agencies, the private sector and multiple users in city-regions (i.e. the city and its wider hinterland) to re-engineer systemically their built environment and urban infrastructure in response to climate change and resource constraints. To inform transitions to urban sustainability, key stakeholders' perceptions were sought though a participatory backcasting and scenario foresight process in order to illuminate challenging but realistic socio-technical scenarios for the systemic retrofit of core UK city-regions. The challenge of conceptualizing complex urban transitions is explored across multiple socio-technical regimes' (housing, non-domestic buildings, urban infrastructure), scales (building, neighbourhood, city-region), and domains (energy, water, use of resources) within a participatory process. The development of three archetypal guiding visions' of retrofit city-regional futures developed through this process are discussed, along with the contribution that such foresight processes might play in opening up' the governance and strategic navigation of urban sustainability.",10.1080/09613218.2013.805063,Building Research and Information,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
59,Ecosystem services of urban green spaces in African countries-perspectives and challenges,Cilliers et al.,2013-01-01,"The concept of ecosystem goods and services is increasingly used to describe how biodiversity and ecosystems are linked to human well-being and that it should be placed at the core of sustainable urban development. Predictions of a tremendous future increase of urbanization in Africa necessitate an investigation into the research on ecosystem goods and services in the urban green infrastructure of Africa. Ecosystem goods and services (ES) are described as the benefits humans derive directly or indirectly from ecosystem functions and are classified as supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services. A literature study focusing on journal papers was conducted. Additionally a case study based on two masters studies was further refined. ES studies in African cities are biased towards South Africa and include assessments and economic valuations in which several different methods were used to determine direct consumptive and non-consumptive and indirect use values. Emphasis was placed on the multifunctional nature of ES. The main objectives of these studies were to sensitize policy makers, planners and the general public about the importance of biodiversity and ES. Ecosystem-based adaptation is discussed as the most appropriate approach in terms of applying knowledge about ES and their values in African cities as many residents still rely on ES from natural areas, but the major ecological, economic and political challenges are acknowledged. A case study focusing on domestic gardens (private green spaces) have indicated that the demand and supply of certain ES differ along a socio-economic gradient due to poor service delivery and smaller plots in the poorer areas mainly due to the legacy of separate development of the past. Where provisioning services are mainly outsourced in cities, it was found that plant species useful as food, medicine, etc. were more frequent in the gardens of poorer residents than in those of more affluent areas. The tendency to pay more for residential properties close to public open spaces, as in Europe, could not be statistically proven in the more affluent areas of a South African city, although the property values in proximity of public open spaces in some of the areas studied were lower than further away.",10.1007/s11252-012-0254-3,Urban Ecosystems,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

In this paper we explore a crucial tension in both the policy and the public debate: a seeming lack of attention to social inclusion and broader equity implications. We pay special attention to the municipal scale, where concerns about social difference and democratic participation are often foregrounded in political discourse, using South East Queensland-a recognised climate change 'hotspot'-as a case study. Mobilising critical discourse analysis techniques, we interrogate three local government climate change response strategies, and place these in the context of transscalar discourse networks which appear to sustain a technocratic, 'ecological modernisation' approach to the issue. Finally, we suggest a broad strategy for reimagining this approach to embed a notion of climate justice in our policy thinking about climate change.",10.1068/c11295,Environment and Planning C-Government and Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The challenges of managing urban water systems under a changing and uncertain climate became starkly apparent during Australia's 'Millennium Drought', a decade-long period of extremely dry conditions throughout the 2000s. As the drought progressed, several state and territory governments assumed control of planning and approvals processes in order to implement large water-supply infrastructure projects with great urgency. However, at the end of the decade La Nina rains saturated catchments, spilled over dam walls and devastated several communities with flooding. Analysis of the frameworks for third-party access, private-sector participation, planning, and water-conservation initiatives reveals that the rules, roles and responsibilities of the many actors are interlinked but not always effectively integrated. The introduction and expansion of competition in the urban water industry are an ongoing experiment with great influence on the governance of the sector and the ways in which water services are planned for and provided.",10.2166/wp.2013.058,Water Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Adaptive governance is an approach that promises to reduce uncertainty by improving the knowledge base for decision making. As uncertainty is an inherent feature of climate adaptation, adaptive governance seems to be a promising approach for improving climate adaptation governance. However, the adaptive governance literature has so far paid little attention to decision-making tools and methods, and the literature on the governance of adaptation is in its infancy in this regard. We argue that climate adaptation governance would benefit from systematic and yet flexible decision-making tools and methods such as participatory multicriteria methods for the evaluation of adaptation options, and that these methods can be linked to key adaptive governance principles. Moving from these premises, we propose a framework that integrates key adaptive governance features into participatory multicriteria methods for the governance of climate adaptation.",10.5751/ES-06381-190274,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Effectively assessing CWS vulnerability requires information and participation from various sources, one of which is stakeholders. In this article, we present a deliberative risk-ranking methodology, the participatory vulnerability scoping diagram (P-VSD), which allows rapid assessment and integration of multiple stakeholder perspectives of vulnerability. This technique is based on methods of deliberative risk evaluation and the vulnerability scoping diagram. The goal of the methodology is to engage CWS managers and stakeholders collectively to provide qualitative contextual risk rankings as a first step in a vulnerability assessment. We conduct an initial assessment using a case study of CWS in two U.S. counties, sites with broadly similar exposures but differences in population, land use, and other social sensitivity factors. Results demonstrate that CWS managers and stakeholders in the two case study communities all share the belief that their CWS are vulnerable to hazards but differ in how this vulnerability manifests itself in terms of the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of the system.",10.1080/00045608.2013.754673,Annals of the Association of American Geographers,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

This empirical study contributes to the body of the literature on collective action and adaptive capacity by demonstrating how organizations frame responses to climate variability and change in rural Kenya by promoting local rural institutions. By analyzing interviews, role-playing games, and household surveys, we ask how local rural organizations shape coping strategies to climate variability and how they may structure future adaptations to climate change. We also investigate what types of households participate in those organizations and how their participation may impact their vulnerability to climate change and variability. Our analysis shows that in places rendered especially vulnerable to climate change by arid climatic conditions, the disengagement of governmental services, and a limited access to income-generating activities, local rural organizations increase livelihood security. Those organizations reduce local vulnerabilities and enhance collective action. In contrast to common diversification and livelihood security strategies which rely on the access to urban or peri-urban structures, local rural institutions and organizations allow for rural and grassroots sustainable adaptation strategies. In that respect, they constitute a resilient and mostly untapped resource for visibly strengthening livelihood security and adaptive capacities in rural Kenya.",10.1007/s10113-012-0343-0,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
66,Options for water storage and rainwater harvesting to improve health and resilience against climate change in Africa,Boelee et al.,2013-01-01,"West and East Africa experience high variability of rainfall that is expected to increase with climate change. This results in fluctuations in water availability for food production and other socioeconomic activities. Water harvesting and storage can mitigate the adverse effects of rainfall variability. But past studies have shown that when investments in water storage are not guided by environmental health considerations, the increased availability of open water surface may increase the transmission of water-related diseases. This is demonstrated for schistosomiasis associated with small reservoirs in Burkina Faso, and for malaria in Ethiopia around large dams, small dams, and water harvesting ponds. The concern is that the rush to develop water harvesting and storage for climate change adaptation may increase the risk for already vulnerable people, in some cases more than canceling out the benefits of greater water availability. Taking health issues into account in a participatory approach to planning, design, and management of rainwater harvesting and water storage, as well as considering the full range of water storage options would enable better opportunities for enhancing resilience against climate change in vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa.",10.1007/s10113-012-0287-4,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
67,A dynamic assessment tool for exploring and communicating vulnerability to floods and climate change,Giupponi et al.,2013-01-01,"In this article we propose an innovative approach to support a participatory modelling process for the exploratory assessment of vulnerability within the broad context of climate change adaptation. The approach provides a simplified dynamic vulnerability model developed within a conceptual model adopted - but very rarely made operational - by many international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, the European Union. We propose a procedure in which disciplinary experts and local actors interact for the identification of the most relevant issues with reference to a specific vulnerability problem. Local actors (e.g. representatives of public administrations, business, NGOs) identify the most relevant issues related to the various dimensions of vulnerability, to be considered as input variables to contextualise the generalised model in the study case. Quantitative indicators are provided by disciplinary experts to describe past and future trends of variables, and their trajectories are combined to explore possible future vulnerability trends and scenarios. A non additive aggregation operator is proposed to allow experts and actors to pro vide their preferences through ad hoc questionnaires, thus overcoming the oversimplifications of most of the current vulnerability indices, which are usually either additive (fully compensatory) or multiplicative (non compensatory), and providing transparent and robust management of subjectivity and analysis of the deriving variability and uncertainty in model outputs. Input data for the demonstration of the model derive from the European Project Brahmatwinn, with reference to the Assam State in India. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

68,Supplying urban ecosystem services through multifunctional green infrastructure in the United States,Lovell and Taylor,2013-01-01,"This paper summarizes a strategy for supplying ecosystem services in urban areas through a participatory planning process targeting multifunctional green infrastructure. We draw from the literature on landscape multifunctionality, which has primarily been applied to agricultural settings, and propose opportunities to develop urban green infrastructure that could contribute to the sustainable social and ecological health of the city. Thinking in terms of system resilience, strategies might focus on the potential for green infrastructure to allow for adaptation and even transformation in the face of future challenges such as climate change, food insecurity, and limited resources. Because planning for multiple functions can be difficult when many diverse stakeholders are involved, we explored decision support tools that could be applied to green infrastructure planning in the early stages, to engage the public and encourage action toward implementing a preferred solution. Several specific ecosystem services that could be relevant for evaluating current and future urban green spaces include: plant biodiversity, food production, microclimate control, soil infiltration, carbon sequestration, visual quality, recreation, and social capital. Integrating such ecosystem services into small-scale greening projects could allow for creativity and local empowerment that would inspire broader transformation of green infrastructure at the city level. Those cities committing to such an approach by supporting greening projects are likely to benefit in the long run through the value of ecosystem services for urban residents and the broader public.",10.1007/s10980-013-9912-y,Landscape Ecology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

We place stakeholder participation within literatures on environmental and climate change decision-making. We conducted participant observation and interviews in two planning workshops to investigate the decision-making process, and our findings are three-fold. First, the inclusion of diverse stakeholders expanded climate change decision-making beyond National Park Service (NPS) institutional constraints. Second, workshops of the Climate Change Scenario Planning Project (CCSPP) enhanced institutional understandings of participants' attitudes towards climate change and climate change decision-making. Third, the geographical context of climate change influences the decision-making process. As the first regional approach to climate change decision-making within the NPS, the CCSPP serves as a model for future climate change planning in public land agencies. This study shows how the participation of stakeholders can contribute to robust decisions, may move climate change decision-making beyond institutional barriers, and can provide information about attitudes towards climate change decision-making.

70,Community-based approaches and partnerships: innovations in health-service delivery in Bangladesh,El Arifeen et al.,2013-01-01,"In Bangladesh, rapid advancements in coverage of many health interventions have coincided with impressive reductions in fertility and rates of maternal, infant, and childhood mortality. These advances, which have taken place despite such challenges as widespread poverty, political instability, and frequent natural disasters, warrant careful analysis of Bangladesh's approach to health-service delivery in the past four decades. With reference to success stories, we explore strategies in health-service delivery that have maximised reach and improved health outcomes. We identify three distinctive features that have enabled Bangladesh to improve health-service coverage and health outcomes: (1) experimentation with, and widespread application of, large-scale community-based approaches, especially investment in community health workers using a doorstep delivery approach; (2) experimentation with informal and contractual partnership arrangements that capitalise on the ability of non-governmental organisations to generate community trust, reach the most deprived populations, and address service gaps; and (3) rapid adoption of context-specific innovative technologies and policies that identify country-specific systems and mechanisms. Continued development of innovative, community-based strategies of health-service delivery, and adaptation of new technologies, are needed to address neglected and emerging health challenges, such as increasing access to skilled birth attendance, improvement of coverage of antenatal care and of nutritional status, the effects of climate change, and chronic disease. Past experience should guide future efforts to address rising public health concerns for Bangladesh and other underdeveloped countries.",10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62149-2,Lancet,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

We surveyed Nevada ranchers and farmers (n = 481) during 2009-2010 to assess climate change related knowledge, assumptions, and perceptions. The large majority of this group agreed that we are in a period of climate change; however, only 29 % of them believed that human activity is playing a significant role. Female ranchers and farmers hold more scientifically accurate knowledge about climate change than do their male counterparts, regardless of Democratic or Republican affiliation. Partisan affiliation, political ideology, and gender have strong impacts on climate change knowledge and perceptions. Republican, conservative and male rural residents view climate change as a low national priority, less important to themselves, and less harmful to their communities. Female ranchers and farmers are more concerned about the negative impacts of climate change. We found that only 4 % of our subjects (n = 299) attribute local environment changes to climate change or global warming. The knowledge gained from this study will help researchers and natural resource managers understand how to best communicate about climate change with rural communities, and support policy makers in identifying potentially effective adaptation and mitigation policies and outreach programs.",10.1007/s10584-013-0979-x,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

While intervention is local and context dependent, current assessments are usually global and abstract. Available assessments are useful for understanding the scale of the effects of climate change and they are ideal for motivating arguments in favor of mitigation and adaptation. However, adaptation projects need assessments that can provide data to support their efforts. This requires the adoption of a more local and context-sensitive approach to assessments.

73,The participation of agricultural stakeholders in assessing regional vulnerability of cropland to soil water erosion in Austria,Mitter et al.,2014-01-01,"Scientists increasingly engage with stakeholders in order to develop more acceptable and applicable solutions particularly for climate change impact, adaptation, and vulnerability assessments. We present methodology, results, and experiences of a participation process in a regional soil water erosion vulnerability assessment in Austria. A peer group consisting of agricultural extension specialists, administration, and scientists identified the impacts of uncertain future precipitation on soil water erosion and the effectiveness of relevant soil conservation measures as the most crucial knowledge gap. We applied the bio-physical process model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate to simulate potential sediment yields using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation methodology and crop yields to calculate gross margins. The simulations have been performed for five climate change scenarios until 2040 and three alternative crop management practices. A heterogeneous expanded stakeholder group provided knowledge on regional crop production and management and thus contributed to a first validation of the model input data. Model results indicate an increase in severely erosion-prone cropland by 76 to 135 % with higher precipitation sums for 2040, on average. Furthermore, reduced tillage and cultivating winter cover crops have been identified as effective adaptation measures reducing mean sediment loss between 7 and 31 %, on average. A peer group validated model output with respect to relevance, plausibility, and usability of results and confirmed the usefulness of the results to inform the public debate on regional climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability in agriculture.",10.1007/s10113-013-0506-7,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The Xinanjiang-Fuchunjiang reservoir cascade, located in Hangzhou Region (China), is selected as case study. We use a scenario-based approach to explore the effects of various likely degrees of water stress for the future period between 2011 and 2040, which are compared to the control period from 1971 to 2000. The scenario impacts are simulated with the WEAP water allocation model, which is interlinked with the NSGA-II metaheuristic algorithm in order to derive optimal operating rules adapted to each scenario. Reservoir performance is measured with the Shortage Index (SI) and Mean Annual Energy Production (MAEP). For the investigated scenarios, adapted operating rules on average reduce the SI with 84 % and increase the MAEP with 6.4 % (compared to the projected future performance of conventional operation). Based on the optimization results, we conclude that for the studied case dam reoperation is an effective adaptation strategy to reduce the impact of changing patterns of water supply and demand, even though it is insufficient to completely restore system performance to that of the control period.",10.1007/s11269-013-0499-5,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
75,"Legitimate adaptive flood risk governance beyond the dikes: the cases of Hamburg, Helsinki and Rotterdam",Mees et al.,2014-01-01,"It has recently been recommended that a shift from traditional flood prevention to more adaptive strategies is made, focusing on the reduction in and recovery from flood impacts as a means to improve resilience to climate impacts. This shift has had implications for the public-private divide in adaptive flood risk governance. In an urban context, it means that private actors such as developers and residents come into play, necessitating governance arrangements which cross the public-private divide. The division of responsibilities for water safety between the public and private sectors affects the way legitimacy is gained for these arrangements and raises new legitimacy issues. The paper offers an analysis of public and private responsibilities in adaptive flood risk governance arrangements, as well as of the legitimacy of the arrangements in the light of the public-private divide. A comparative case study is presented for three urban regeneration projects in un-embanked areas in Hamburg, Germany, Helsinki, Finland, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where adaptive strategies have been applied. The results show that network arrangements with joint public-private responsibilities use direct forms of participation and deliberation, but that these do not necessarily lead to more legitimate arrangements in the eyes of stakeholders as is often suggested in the literature. Both network and more public hierarchical arrangements can be perceived as quite legitimate under certain conditions.",10.1007/s10113-013-0527-2,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
76,Bridging the Gap Between the Theory and Practices of Stakeholder Participation in Integrated Vulnerability Assessments of Climate Change,Scherhaufer,2014-01-01,"In the international climate regime, integrated vulnerability assessments have become the most prominent method of investigating the potential effects of climate change. Vulnerability assessments typically operate on a local to regional level, where it is most likely to inform subsequent decision making. To cope with the inherent complexity of the climate change problem, the corresponding uncertainties and the aim of producing useful and actionable knowledge various degrees of stakeholder participation have become a critical part of participatory integrated vulnerability assessments. The present study relies upon Fiorino's (Sci Technol Hum Values 15(2):226-243, 1990) heuristic distinctions between the normative, instrumental and substantive rationales of participation, and it investigates two internationally renowned case studies to demonstrate the consequences of the design and conduct of participatory processes. An analysis of the interplay of the purposes and practices of stakeholder integration points to four fundamental challenges of participatory integrated assessments: knowledge integration, interest convergence, causality and representation. At the end two exit options are discussed, which aim to overcome some obstacles of using the concept of participation in the assessment efforts. This paper therefore goes beyond the typical analyses of ways to better organize and steer the process of stakeholder participation and wants to make a contribution to improve future integrated vulnerability assessments of climate change.",10.1007/s11213-013-9294-8,Systemic Practice and Action Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Researchers who study collaborative governance systems in the public administration, planning and policy literature have paid less attention to adaptive capacity specifically and institutional adaptation in general. This paper bridges the two literatures and finds four common dimensions of capacity, including structural arrangements, leadership, knowledge and learning, and resources. In this paper, we focus on institutional adaptation in the context of collaborative governance regimes and try to clarify and distinguish collaborative capacity from adaptive capacity and their contributions to adaptive action. We posit further that collaborative capacities generate associated adaptive capacities thereby enabling institutional adaptation within collaborative governance regimes. We develop these distinctions and linkages between collaborative and adaptive capacities with the help of an illustrative case study in watershed management within the National Estuary Program.",10.1007/s00267-014-0334-7,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
78,Visual Climate Change Communication: From Iconography to Locally Framed,Schroth et al.,2014-01-01,"Climate change is an urgent problem with implications registered not only globally, but also on national and local scales. It is a particularly challenging case of environmental communication because its main cause, greenhouse gas emissions, is invisible. The predominant approach of making climate change visible is the use of iconic, often affective, imagery. Literature on the iconography of climate change shows that global iconic motifs, such as polar bears, have contributed to a public perception of the problem as spatially and temporally remote. This paper proposes an alternative approach to global climate change icons by focusing on recognizable representations of local impacts within an interactive game environment. This approach was implemented and tested in a research project based on the municipality of Delta, British Columbia. A major outcome of the research is Future Delta, an interactive educational game featuring 3D visualizations and simulation tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation future scenarios. The empirical evaluation is based on quantitative pre/post-game play questionnaires with 18 students and 10 qualitative expert interviews.

79,Moving out or living on a mound? Jointly planning a Dutch flood adaptation project,Roth and Winnubst,2014-01-01,"All over the world spatial flood risk management policies are on the rise. This paper analyses the planning process for the Overdiepse polder, a so-called ""Room for the River"" project in the Netherlands. After high water in the 1990s, the Dutch government changed its flood risk management policy. While before 2000 it leaned heavily on dikes to separate water from land, after that year spatial measures to ""let the water flow"" were introduced. This required the integration of two formerly separated policy domains: flood risk management and land use planning. In the densely populated and economically highly developed Netherlands, returning space to the river unavoidably impacts on the lives and livelihoods of those who live and work along the rivers. Therefore, such spatial measures to decrease flood risk have to be negotiated with various stakeholders. The planning process towards making the Overdiepse polder suitable for temporary water storage deserves more in-depth analysis. We describe and analyze the development of relationships between key actors in the planning process, with a focus on planning practices rather than on assumptions about the existence of certain types and qualities of relationships. We conclude, among others, that citizen involvement can, under specific socio-political and institutional conditions, build trust among stakeholders and increase local legitimacy for interventions by government agencies. However, it should not be idealized as ""self-governance"" or assumed to be part of a unidirectional change in water interventions towards new relationships between actors.

The current articulations of these two approaches are strongly converging, but each approach has its strengths. Resilience thinking has developed theoretical models to the study of social-ecological systems, whereas ecohealth has a vast repertoire of experience in dealing with complex health issues. With the two fields dovetailing, there is ripe opportunity to create a dialog centered on concepts that are more thoroughly developed in one field, which can then serve to advance the other. In this article, we first present an overview of the ecohealth and resilience thinking frameworks before opening a dialog centered on seven themes that have strong potential for cross-pollination between the two approaches: scale interactions, regime shifts, adaptive environmental management, social learning, participation, social and gender equity, and knowledge to action. We conclude with some future research suggestions for those interested in theoretical and practical applications at the intersection of environment and health. In particular, closer collaboration between these two fields can lead to addressing blind spots in the ecosystem services framework, complementary social-network analysis, the application of resilience heuristics to the understanding of health, and the development of a normative dimension in resilience thinking.",10.5751/ES-06264-190224,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The implementation of pro-active, planned adaptation to reduce community vulnerability is strongly dependent upon people's perception of the threat posed to their communities at the local scale.

With a focus on a case study situated in the Tantramar area of South-East New Brunswick, Canada an area subject to very large tidal forces from the Bay of Fundy this study set out to assess public awareness about the link between climate change and elevated risk of regional dyke failure, measure how different multi-media visualizations influence public risk perception, and provide general recommendations for the development of flood risk communication strategies in coastal zones. The results from 14 focus groups (n = 157 participants) revealed that 81% of respondents felt that the problem of climate change was considerable or severe. However, when asked for their assessment of personal vulnerability to dyke failure and subsequent coastal flooding, only 35.6% considered themselves to be at considerable or severe personal risk.

The challenge of adaptation facing Portuguese coastal communities: Risk perception, trust-building and genuine participation",Schmidt et al.,2014-01-01,"The Portuguese coast is experiencing severe erosion and loss of beachfront, processes which are expected to become worse with climate change impacts. These additional alterations are beginning to show at a time when financing for conventional coastal protection is no longer guaranteed at scales of investment which are likely to be required if future coastlines are to be maintained. This paper looks at how residents and key stakeholders of three coastal communities in Portugal perceive such possible changes, how far they judge and trust current coastal management, and how they perceive their current participation and foresee future forms of involvement on adaptive coastal change. The evidence from these surveys and interviews suggests that there is a strong commitment in each location to maintaining current levels of coastal protection, and to preserving the integrity of local societies and economies, even though there is also recognition that adaptation in some form will eventually be required. However, our research reveals that there is not yet sufficient trust between coastal stakeholders, especially towards public institutions and policies, for any degree of progressive coastal adaptation to take place. Building trust in creative learning processes of progressive adaptation could lead to improved science and participation along with a meaningful dialogue over cooperative coastal planning and financing. The research undertaken for this paper lays the groundwork for such a process of trust-building to begin. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Community participation was adopted as one of the guiding principles for implementing the Plan, especially as behavioural change is likely to be important for adaptation and coping strategies. Multisectorial co-operation is also imperative, as many of the climate-related health risks involve multiple multidisciplinary stakeholders to implement appropriate interventions. Addressing inequalities and poverty in SA is critical to ensure that the health impacts from climate change are mitigated, particularly as current evidence suggests that the largest health risks are possibly among communities already most impacted by climate-related diseases. More research is needed to determine the impact of climate on health and which communities are the most vulnerable.

This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for assessing city plans based on the idea of sustainability and planning countering climate change. It applies this framework to assess the recent master plan for the city of New York City: PlaNYC 2030. The framework consists of eight concepts that were identified through conceptual analyses of the planning and interdisciplinary literature on sustainability and climate change. Using the proposed conceptual framework to evaluate PlaNYC 2030 reveals some of the merits of the Plan. PlaNYC promotes greater compactness and density, enhanced mixed land use, sustainable transportation, greening, and renewal and utilization of underused land. With regard to the concept of uncertainty, it addresses future uncertainties related to climate change with institutional measures only. From the perspective of ecological economics, the Plan creates a number of mechanisms to promote its climate change goals and to create a cleaner environment for economic investment. It offers an ambitious vision of reducing emissions by 30% and creating a greener, greater New York, and links this vision with the international agenda for climate change. On the other hand, the assessment reveals that PlaNYC did not make a radical shift toward planning for climate change and adaptation. It inadequately addresses social planning issues that are crucial to New York City. NYC is socially differentiated in terms of the capacity of communities to meet climate change uncertainties, and the Plan fails to address the issues facing vulnerable communities due to climate change. The Plan calls for an integrative approach to climate change on the institutional level, but it fails to effectively integrate civil society, communities, and grassroots organizations into the process. The lack of a systematic procedure for public participation throughout the city's neighborhoods and among different social groupings and other stakeholders is a critical shortcoming, particularly during the current age of climate change uncertainty. Practically, the proposed conceptual framework of evaluate appears to be an effective and constructive means of illuminating the Plan's strengths and weaknesses, and appears to be an easy-to-grasp evaluation method, and should be easily understood and applied by scholars, practitioners and policy makers.",10.3390/su6095898,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The sale of water entitlements has positive and negative consequences for irrigators and rural communities. This study focuses specifically on these potential on-farm consequences, by providing an overview of the reasons irrigators sell water, examining fluctuations in water use by irrigators overtime, and modelling the delayed impact of water sales in the previous five years on net farm income. It suggests that to date, many irrigators who sold water to the Commonwealth and continued farming in the southern Murray-Darling Basin have predominately sold their surplus and buffer water (water not used in production). There is only weak to no significant evidence from the regression modelling to suggest that there is a delayed negative impact on net farm income from selling water entitlements, which supports the notion that the reduction in farm production has been offset by many irrigators using water sales proceeds to reduce debt (and hence interest payments), restructure and reinvest on farm. However, given the advent of climate change and future water scarcity, all irrigators, but particularly for some of those who have sold part of their water entitlements, will need to plan for further incremental adaptation, water management or on-farm changes, or risk facing regular water shortages.

87,Exploring critical pathways for urban water management to identify robust strategies under deep uncertainties,Urich and Rauch,2014-01-01,"Long-term projections for key drivers needed in urban water infrastructure planning such as climate change, population growth, and socio-economic changes are deeply uncertain. Traditional planning approaches heavily rely on these projections, which, if a projection stays unfulfilled, can lead to problematic infrastructure decisions causing high operational costs and/or lock-in effects. New approaches based on exploratory modelling take a fundamentally different view. Aim of these is, to identify an adaptation strategy that performs well under many future scenarios, instead of optimising a strategy for a handful. However, a modelling tool to support strategic planning to test the implication of adaptation strategies under deeply uncertain conditions for urban water management does not exist yet. This paper presents a first step towards a new generation of such strategic planning tools, by combing innovative modelling tools, which coevolve the urban environment and urban water infrastructure under many different future scenarios, with robust decision making. The developed approach is applied to the city of Innsbruck, Austria, which is spatially explicitly evolved 20 years into the future under 1000 scenarios to test the robustness of different adaptation strategies. Key findings of this paper show that: (1) Such an approach can be used to successfully identify parameter ranges of key drivers in which a desired performance criterion is not fulfilled, which is an important indicator for the robustness of an adaptation strategy; and (2) Analysis of the rich dataset gives new insights into the adaptive responses of agents to key drivers in the urban system by modifying a strategy.

88,Opinions on strategies for forest adaptation to future climate conditions in western Canada: surveys of the general public and leaders of forest-dependent communities,Hajjar et al.,2014-01-01,"Two province-wide surveys of residents in Alberta and British Columbia were conducted to assess the acceptability of a range of reforestation strategies-many of which revolve around biotechnology-that could be used to aid western Canada's forests in adapting to future climate change. The opinions of leaders of forest-dependent communities were also sought to evaluate how well they align with those of the public at large. Results show that the views of the general public and community leaders correspond. There is a low acceptance for a ""do-nothing"" strategy that allows climate change to run its course without any human intervention; high acceptance of replanting with local seeds; a decreasing acceptance of strategies that involve more manipulation such as breeding, using nonlocal seeds, and moving seeds outside of a species' natural range; and a low acceptance of genetically engineered solutions. However, a high proportion of respondents changed their answers when told that a particular strategy would lead to either favourable or unfavourable outcomes related to socioeconomics of forest-dependent communities, forest aesthetics, and pest, disease, and fire outbreaks. We conclude that a meaningful and participatory dialogue on forest adaptation strategies in the face of climate change can only emerge if residents and other interested stakeholders have an adequate understanding of current forest management practices, proposed reforestation strategies, the role of technological interventions, and the values and services for which western Canada's forests are to be managed.",10.1139/cjfr-2014-0142,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

90,Exploring global scientific discourses on urban forestry,Ostoic and van den Bosch,2015-01-01,"The concept of urban forestry is addressed from a discursive perspective, with focus on identifying and describing various scientific discourses, their strength and development over time and on different continents. This work can help obtain a deeper understanding of the scientific discourses in terms of identifying research trends and reasons behind these trends, as a possible way forward for research. Scientific publications (N = 519) issued during the period 1988-2014 (and as listed in the SCOPUS database) were analysed with the aims to 1) systematically identify and describe scientific urban forestry discourses, 2) discuss implications of these findings for scientific practice, and 3) propose ways forward. Six discourses of various strength and geographical distribution were identified. Scientific production was found to be dominated by North American and European authors with modest contributions from authors from other continents. Scientific discourses proved mostly expert driven and reflecting the positivist scientific paradigm. Prevailingly managerial orientation and absence of qualitative approaches indicate a lack of deeper understanding of human-environment relations. Studies related to active participation of citizens and partnerships in urban forestry have been missing. More emphasis should be placed on the testing of existing, and developing new methods and modalities of public participation, and on the value of civic involvement for the decision making. Moreover, a more solid evidence base is needed for benefits from urban forests, while economic aspects of biodiversity and other ecosystem services are still insufficiently explored. Study findings also call for more research on urban forest governance and relation between urban forest benefits and existing policies (e.g. climate change adaptation, energy policy or health).

91,Do state traditions matter? Comparing deliberative governance initiatives for climate change adaptation in Dutch corporatism and British pluralism,Vink et al.,2015-01-01,"In the emerging field of climate adaptation, deliberative governance initiatives are proposed to yield better adaptation strategies. However, introducing these network-centred deliberations between public and private players may contrast with institutionalized traditions of interest intermediation between state and society. This paper shows how these so-called state traditions affect the processes and outcomes of newly set up deliberative governance initiatives. Because of the similarities in geographical characteristics and the differences in state tradition we conducted a qualitative case study comparison of Dutch and British water management. Our comparison is two-fold. First, we compare deliberative governance initiatives in the different state traditions of the Netherlands and UK. Second, we compare the newly set up deliberative governance initiative to an existing policy regime mainstreaming climate adaptation in a similar state tradition, in our case the Netherlands. We find that: (1) deliberative governance initiatives in the corporatist state tradition of the Netherlands yields learning but shows apathy among politically elected decision-makers compared to deliberative governance initiatives in the pluralist state tradition of the UK where clearly defined rules and responsibilities yields negotiation and action; and (2) a typical corporatist policy regime mainstreaming climate adaption in a corporatist state tradition yields effective and legitimate policy formation but lacks learning.",10.2166/wcc.2014.119,Journal of Water and Climate Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
92,Vulnerability of Poor Urban Women to Climate-linked Water Insecurities at the Household Level: A Case Study of Slums in Delhi,Kher et al.,2015-01-01,"In most developing countries rural, peri-urban slum women and girls spend several hours every day in water accession and management. Climate change coupled with demographic and technological factors further confound this scenario. This study assesses the vulnerability of poor women to climate-linked water insecurities in Delhi, the capital of India, where almost 20 per cent of its people live in slums and related settlements. This study made a qualitative and quantitative assessment of water-related needs of women living in slums across different regions of the city. Considering the rapid growth of slums, climatic changes and little change in the gendered distribution of domestic responsibilities, women are likely to spend huge amounts of time in meeting their practical gender needs of water and other resources. Their strategic gender needs of education, skill development and income will continue to be ignored leading to persistent gender gaps in attainments in different sectors. It is therefore very important to enhance the overall adaptive capacity of urban poor women to face the challenges of rapid urbanisation and climate change.",10.1177/0971521514556943,Indian Journal of Gender Studies,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
93,"Importance of anthropogenic climate impact, sampling error and urban development in sewer system design",Egger and Maurer,2015-01-01,"Urban drainage design relying on observed precipitation series neglects the uncertainties associated with current and indeed future climate variability. Urban drainage design is further affected by the large stochastic variability of precipitation extremes and sampling errors arising from the short observation periods of extreme precipitation. Stochastic downscaling addresses anthropogenic climate impact by allowing relevant precipitation characteristics to be derived from local observations and an ensemble of climate models. This multi-climate model approach seeks to reflect the uncertainties in the data due to structural errors of the climate models. An ensemble of outcomes from stochastic downscaling allows for addressing the sampling uncertainty. These uncertainties are clearly reflected in the precipitation-runoff predictions of three urban drainage systems. They were mostly due to the sampling uncertainty. The contribution of climate model uncertainty was found to be of minor importance. Under the applied greenhouse gas emission scenario (A1B) and within the period 2036-2065, the potential for urban flooding in our Swiss case study is slightly reduced on average compared to the reference period 1981-2010. Scenario planning was applied to consider urban development associated with future socio-economic factors affecting urban drainage. The impact of scenario uncertainty was to a large extent found to be case-specific, thus emphasizing the need for scenario planning in every individual case. The results represent a valuable basis for discussions of new drainage design standards aiming specifically to include considerations of uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

94,Impacts of Climate Change on Vector Borne Diseases in the Mediterranean Basin - Implications for Preparedness and Adaptation Policy,Negev et al.,2015-01-01,"The Mediterranean region is vulnerable to climatic changes. A warming trend exists in the basin with changes in rainfall patterns. It is expected that vector-borne diseases (VBD) in the region will be influenced by climate change since weather conditions influence their emergence. For some diseases (i.e., West Nile virus) the linkage between emergence andclimate change was recently proved; for others (such as dengue) the risk for local transmission is real. Consequently, adaptation and preparation for changing patterns of VBD distribution is crucial in the Mediterranean basin. We analyzed six representative Mediterranean countries and found that they have started to prepare for this threat, but the preparation levels among them differ, and policy mechanisms are limited and basic. Furthermore, cross-border cooperation is not stable and depends on international frameworks. The Mediterranean countries should improve their adaptation plans, and develop more cross-sectoral, multidisciplinary and participatory approaches. In addition, based on experience from existing local networks in advancing national legislation and trans-border cooperation, we outline recommendations for a regional cooperation framework. We suggest that a stable and neutral framework is required, and that it should address the characteristics and needs of African, Asian and European countries around the Mediterranean in order to ensure participation. Such a regional framework is essential to reduce the risk of VBD transmission, since the vectors of infectious diseases know no political borders.",10.3390/ijerph120606745,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
95,"The split ladder of participation: A diagnostic, strategic, and evaluation tool to assess when participation is necessary",Hurlbert and Gupta,2015-01-01,"The mainstream literature sees participation as critical to deepening democracy and solving complex environmental issues. An explosion of literature on public participation has occurred since Amstein's ladder of participation in (1969). However, the literature does not address the conditions under which participation is likely to work and what it can achieve in different circumstances. In order to address these questions, this paper reviews the literature on participation, learning, trust, governance and management and conceptualizes the analysis through developing the split ladder of participation. It creates four ideal typical circumstances and explains what the nature and goal of stakeholder participation is for each circumstance. This model is then tested in four case studies in Mendoza, Argentina, Coquimbo, Chile, and Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. This split ladder is presented as both a diagnostic and evaluation tool and is supported through the use of examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

96,The Canadian Arctic Marine Ecological Footprint and Free Prior Informed Consent: Making the Case for Indigenous Public Participation through Inclusive Education,Koutouki et al.,2015-01-01,"Public participation of the Inuit concerning climate change adaptation in the Canadian Arctic is essential, given the extensive knowledge they possess about their traditional territories, especially as it relates to resources management. Unfortunately, much of this knowledge is not incorporated into the tertiary educational system and hence not part of the knowledge set of the people most likely to engage in public policy discussions and decisions. This article adopts a transdisciplinary approach, using an analysis of historic fish and marine mammal catch with the marine ecological footprint calculated for the year 2000. This scientific data, supported by the principle of free and prior informed consent as defined in United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as well as the Tsilhqot'in case in Canada, demonstrates the need for inclusive education. We conclude that indigenous participation in climate change adaptation policies would benefit immensely from the offering of university programmes that incorporate, in a meaningful way, Inuit traditional knowledge and indigenous rights.",10.1111/reel.12119,Review of European Comparative & International Environmental Law,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
97,A dynamic assessment of water scarcity risk in the Lower Brahmaputra River Basin: An integrated approach,Gain and Giupponi,2015-01-01,"Many international river basins are likely to experience increasing water scarcity over the coming decades. This water scarcity is not rooted only in the limitation of resources, i.e. the shortage in the availability of freshwater relative to water demand, but also on social factors (e.g. flawed water planning and management approaches, institutional incapability to provide water services, unsustainable economic policies). Therefore, the assessment of water scarcity risks is not limited to the assessment of physical water supply and demand, but it requires also consideration of several socio-economic factors. In this study, we provide a comprehensive dynamic assessment of water scarcity risks for the Lower Brahmaputra river basin, a region where the hydrological impact of climate change is expected to be particularly strong and population pressure is high. The basin area of Brahmaputra River lies among four different countries: China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan. For water scarcity assessment, we propose a novel integration of different approaches: (i) the assessment of water scarcity risk, considering complex social-ecological system; (ii) the analysis of dynamic behaviour of the system; (iii) exploration of participatory approach in which limited number of stakeholders identify the most relevant issues with reference to water scarcity risks and provide their preferences for the aggregation of risk assessment indicators. Results show that water scarcity risk is expected to slightly increase and to fluctuate remarkably as a function of the hazard signal. Social indicators show trends that can at least partially compensate the increasing trend of the drought index. The results of this study are intended to be used for contributing to planned adaptation of water resources systems, in Lower Brahmaputra River Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

98,Local perceptions of rangeland degradation and climate change in the pastoral society of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,Wu et al.,2015-01-01,"Rangelands provide several valuable ecological services and provide for the livelihoods of local herders on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, rangelands are being degraded due to overgrazing, policy changes and climate change. In this context, a survey was conducted in Zhuaxixiulong township of Gansu Province, China to examine the rangeland management systems and identify problems herders are facing in terms of livestock production and livelihoods using a Participatory Rural Appraisal approach. The results indicated that local herders perceived recent trends in rangeland degradation, climatic change, and political changes, and had developed management practices to adapt to these changes, such as adjusting transhumance patterns, cooperating with local institutions and adopting more collective actions in production practices. This study suggests that, to promote a sustainable rangeland management system in the QTP, policy-makers should recognise indigenous knowledge systems of grazing practices and rangeland management, as well as the need for more advanced technical methods. More attention should be paid to recent changes in climate, social transformations and economic changes to enhance the viability of such a pastoral society. To ensure the sustainability of the social-ecological system, there is a need to strengthen public participation and cooperation with all types of institutions to formulate appropriate policies and improve public services.",10.1071/RJ14082,Rangeland Journal,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
99,Efficiency of Plant Breeding,Ceccarelli,2015-01-01,"Participatory plant breeding (PPB) has been practiced for several reasons, including sociological, humanitarian, and egalitarian. This paper aims to demonstrate that PPB should be practiced simply because it increases plant breeding efficiency, which is defined as (i) the ratio between the number of varieties adopted and the number of crosses made, (ii) the response to selection, and (iii) the benefit/cost ratio, not only as often done by public breeding programs, by the number of varieties released by public breeding programs. After reviewing the reasons for the lack of adoption of several of the varieties released, and the theoretical basis justifying the use of correlated response to measure selection gains, the issue of the benefit/cost ratio is discussed within the context of adoption rates. The assumption is that without adoption, no benefit will occur. Ways to increase the three measures of breeding efficiency are discussed in detail, and the conclusion is made that the three measures can be increased by combining decentralized selection with farmers' participation in a PPB program. The essential features of a PPB program are reviewed, including the experimental designs and statistical analysis used to increase the precision of on-farm trials. The findings show that PPB increases breeding efficiency, both in terms of response to selection measured over the time from the initial cross to adoption and in terms of the benefit/cost ratio as a consequence of a higher adoption rate. In a PPB program, adoption starts during the process of selection and precedes variety release. In a conventional plant breeding (CPB) program, the sequence is reversed. Other differences between a PPB and a CPB program include the increase of agrobiodiversity, which in a PPB program is higher because of the rapid spatiotemporal turnover of varieties, and because the seed of new varieties is readily available to farmers, thus contributing to food security. Because of its decentralized nature, PPB can accommodate organic farms and become easily adopted by both national and international public breeding programs as one way of adapting crops to climate changes.",10.2135/cropsci2014.02.0158,Crop Science,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
100,"Our commitment to climate change is dependent on past, present and future emissions and decisions",Rummukainen,2015-01-01,"The present day global climate change is fueled by our use of fossil fuels and land use change. The already observed warming and other distinct changes in the climate system stem from these human influences and are ongoing. Due to climate system inertia, a part of the climate system's response to this historical forcing remains to manifest itself, which it will do over time. At the same time, socio-economic forces and trends imply some amount of additional emission and land use change, which compounds our commitment to even more substantial climate change. Cumulative carbon dioxide emissions are the basic determinant of the ultimate amount of anthropogenic climate change. Climate system properties, such as climate sensitivity and the carbon cycle, and also possible initiation of non-linear changes, further shape the amount and nature of the long-term change for any set amount of greenhouse gas emissions. While a changed climate is, in practice, now unavoidable, our commitment to continued climate change can be constrained by reductions of global carbon dioxide emissions, their cessation and/or negative emissions. These alternatives have different implications for the long-term unfolding of these changes, but can all considerably reduce the possibility of very large amounts of change, the need for adaptation and responses to negative impacts.",10.3354/cr01279,Climate Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
101,Evaluating Effective Public Participation in Disaster Management and Climate Change Adaptation: Insights From Northern Ghana Through a User-Based Approach,Samaddar et al.,2015-01-01,"Public participation in disaster risk management and climate change adaptation program is acknowledged by researchers and practitioners, yet its actualization largely remains a dream. In principle, there have been several claims in favor of adopting community participation, albeit these remain anecdotal without empirical substance. The few apparent success stories are seldom scaled up or replicated, compelling most enthusiastic practitioners and planners become skeptical about the use of public participation concept in disaster management strategies. This calls for a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of participatory approaches to guide practitioners in their quest for meaningful local community participation in disaster risk management. Based on our case study in disaster prone villages in Northern Ghana, our research contributes to these emerging literature on risks by examining the process and outcome-based factors that ensure effective public participation. The inimitability of our study does not only lie in its pioneering attempt to systematically identify effective public participation factors for climate change, but unlike other participatory approaches where success is defined by the researchers and policy makers, ours relies on local community themselves to define the desired processes for and outcomes of effective public participation.",10.1002/rhc3.12075,Risk Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
102,"Preventive resettlement in anticipation of sea level rise: a choice experiment from Alexandria, Egypt",Kloos and Baumert,2015-01-01,"The city of Alexandria, Egypt, is highly exposed to sea level rise putting communities at risk to related coastal hazards such as storm surges and inundation. In the future, preventive resettlement may become a realistic and, under some conditions, unavoidable adaptation policy to sea level rise. Many examples of failed resettlement projects exist worldwide, wherein the resettled populations faced increased social and economic risks. This paper investigates the preferences of vulnerable people in Alexandria for preventive resettlement programs in response to sea level rise. A choice experiment was conducted to assess the willingness to participate in voluntary resettlement programs and to identify important factors that influence the decision to participate. This can help policy makers to design people-centered resettlement programs that provide the right incentives to increase voluntary participation. Results show that for those who are, in principle, willing to resettle, factors such as transparency of the relocation process, public/social infrastructure, financial compensation, housing and income/job security can significantly influence their choices. However, a large share of the population is not willing to resettle given the proposed alternative resettlement programs included in the choice experiment. Urban households are more likely to be unwilling to resettle, while factors such as income insecurity and fewer social relationships decrease the probability of choosing not to resettle ceteris paribus.",10.1007/s11069-014-1475-y,Natural Hazards,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

To help address this gap, this article presents a typology of spatial planning instruments for adaptation and analyses the pattern of instrument choice in Australian planning processes in order to shed light on contextual factors that can impede adaptation. The analysis highlights how policy design can amplify the barriers to adaptation by arranging policy actors in ways inimical to reform and stripping decision makers of the instruments necessary to make and sustain desired policy changes.",10.1080/09640568.2014.930706,Journal of Environmental Planning and Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
104,Resource efficiency and the imagined public: Insights from cultural theory,Sharp et al.,2015-01-01,"Resource efficiency initiatives seek to moderate how water and energy are used at a domestic level. They can address local and regional issues of resource supply while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and water in-security, hence enabling both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Although they form an increasingly important part of our resource governance landscape, these interventions have received relatively little academic scrutiny to date. Utilising the concept of the 'imagined public' as a lens through which to apply an interpretive version of Douglas' cultural theory, this paper presents a novel conceptual framework to analyse the governance of such initiatives. The framework distinguishes between interventions based on assumptions about potential householder participants, 'the imagined public', which are reflected in the initiatives' design and implementation. The framework is applied to compare three initiatives located in the increasingly populous, but water-scarce, county of Kent (southeast England). The analysis reveals whether and how institutional objectives are met; it also describes the interventions' environmental and socio-political contributions, and uncovers how learning occurs between initiatives. This research suggests that whilst the target interventions differed in their assumptions, design and implementation, they all made a small contribution to more sustainable resource governance. Fundamentally, the initiatives' impact on resource consumption was limited due to a shared technorational approach and a narrow framing of their household participants. Moreover, while all three initiatives demonstrated aspects of cumulative institutional learning, the closer involvement of resource providers and a modified funding framework are suggested as a means to engender the transformative change required for achieving greater resource efficiency. The paper concludes that the proposed conceptual framework provides a useful means to analyse, map, and enhance resource efficiency initiatives. Further, it is argued that the framework also has wider application in addressing broader environmental and social governance challenges. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Based on the causal analysis of the historical typhoon cases in the Guangdong Province of China, this study indicates that structural measures alone are not sufficient to resist and offset the impacts caused by typhoon disasters. Additionally, structural measures are unsustainable due to their high investment and low security. Adaptive governance, which uses non-structural measures and resilience building, is a feasible and cost-effective strategy for responding to the cascading effects of typhoon disasters. Multi-stakeholder participation and vertical-horizontal coordination are essential for providing adaptive governance to typhoon disasters. A risk-sharing model was put forward by bringing together the government, insurance companies and victims. Furthermore, a favorable atmosphere for public participation in disaster risk reduction can be fostered and should be a long-term adaptation strategy. The views and frameworks of adaptive governance provide policy makers with insights on coastal disaster risk management within the broader context of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

106,Adopting public values and climate change adaptation strategies in urban forest management: A review and analysis of the relevant literature,Barona,2015-01-01,"Urban trees are a dominant natural element in cities; they provide important ecosystem services to urban citizens and help urban areas adapt to climate change. Many rationales have been proposed to provide a purpose for urban forest management, some of which have been ineffective in addressing important ecological and social management themes. Among these rationales we find a values-based perspective, which sees management as a process where the desires of urban dwellers are met. Another perspective is climate change adaptation, which sees management as a process where urban forest vulnerability to climate change is reduced and resilience enhanced. Both these rationales have the advantage of complementing, enhancing, and broadening urban forest management objectives. A critical analysis of the literature on public values related to urban forests and climate change adaptation in the context of urban forests is undertaken to discuss what it means to adopt these two issues in urban forest management. The analysis suggests that by seeing urban forest management as a process by which public values are satisfied and urban-forest vulnerabilities to climate change are reduced, we can place issues such as naturalization, adaptive management, and engaging people in management at the centre of urban forest management. Focusing urban forest management on these issues may help ensure the success of programs focused on planting more trees and increasing citizen participation in urban forest management.

We assessed the relative vulnerability of 3143 United States (U.S.) counties to loss of drinking water access due to droughts, floods, and cyclones. Five vulnerability assessment models from the literature were compared, each differing in the aggregation method used to combine the three determinants of vulnerability (V) - exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC). Exposure scores were calculated using historical occurrence data, sensitivity scores were determined from the intrinsic resilience of the drinking water technologies, and adaptive capacity scores were calculated from nine socioeconomic indicators. Our results showed that models V = E + S + AC and V = E + S-AC were the same, as were models V = E x S x AC and V = E x S A center dot AC. Between these two model forms (form 1: V = E + S + AC and V = E + S-AC; form 2: V = E Au S Au AC and V = E Au S A center dot AC), scores from one model form could be used to predict scores from the second model form, with R-squared values ranging from 0.61 to 0.82 depending on the extreme weather event type. A fifth model, V = (E-AC) Au S was not found to correlate with any of the other four models. We used V = E + S + AC as our reference model as this resulted in a more uniform distribution of counties in each of the five intervals of vulnerability. Comparing the vulnerability scores identified the counties with greatest vulnerability to losing access to drinking water due to floods, droughts, and cyclones. Our results can be used to inform evidence-based decisions such as allocation of resources and implementation of adaptation strategies.",10.1007/s10584-015-1493-0,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
108,Comprehensive local climate policy: The role of urban governance,Lee and Painter,2015-01-01,"Given that climate change is a complicated collective action problem, local governments need a comprehensive approach to tackle climate change issues. Comprehensive climate policies concern an integrated approach in planning and implementing of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Yet, not all local governments are actively engaged in global climate issues in a comprehensive manner. Why does local government's commitment on comprehensive climate change policy vary? This study analyzes the influences of urban climate change governance arrangements on the level of comprehensiveness in city-level climate change policies, using case studies of four cities. Urban climate change governance arrangement that includes researchers, NGO (Nongovernmental Organization) s along with public officials is a necessary factor for a city government to develop comprehensive climate policy. The case studies illustrate that cities with well-developed climate change governing organizations (Seattle and Seoul) present comprehensive climate change policy. Urban climate governance arrangements set the climate action agenda and promote implementation schemes. However, Anaheim and Busan have neither well developed urban governance arrangements nor comprehensive climate policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

109,"Community sustainability and resilience: similarities, differences and indicators",Lew et al.,2016-01-01,"Sustainability has been a core conceptual framework for community development since the approach was popularized in 1987, although in its essence it reflects a long history of environmental conservation reactions to industrialization. Resilience, as a framework for understanding and approaching community development, emerged more gradually out of ecological studies in the 1980s, but has only recently, since the mid-2000s, emerged as a focus of public interest as a way of responding and adapting to the planet's growing anthropogenic changes. For many, sustainability and resilience are slightly nuanced perspectives on the same phenomenon. For others, however, there are distinct differences between them, with sustainability's conservation goals being in opposition to the adaptation goals of resilience. Two major reasons for these confusions are (1) both concepts are defined and used in many different ways to achieve a variety of political goals that may not reflect their core definitions, and (2) both concepts share similar goals and some common approaches, such as a focus on climate change and seeking a balance between humans and nature. Returning to the core definitions of conservation and adaptation helps to clarify their similarities and differences, as well as to articulate indicators for understanding how each applies to community tourism development. Indicators from research in rural Taiwan tourism communities were therefore based on responses to the questions: What does the community want to conserve and how do they want to do it (sustainability)? What do they want to change and how do they want to do it (resilience)? Preliminary results suggest that the new ideal community is the one that is both sustainable and resilient.",10.1080/14616688.2015.1122664,Tourism Geographies,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Recent studies show that these calls are taken up only reluctantly in local adaptation compared to sectoral and technical solutions. The aim of this study is to examine to which extent adaptation as an embedded process within the local context allows for stakeholder participation, cooperation and the robustness and flexibility of adaptation measures. It applies an analytical approach, combining an action framework of adaptation and document-based discourse analysis, to assess both the procedural and the substantive viewpoint of an adaptation case in Finland. This twofold approach provides insight into how the adaptation process and content influence and condition each other. The analysis highlights how new approaches to adaptation have to compete with prevailing discourses and institutionalised practices, as public authorities take the dominant role in adaptation, striving for certain and safe solutions.

111,"Water Markets, Environmental Flows, and Adaptation to Climate Change",Ancev,2015-01-01,"The possibility of climate change and the effects it will have on global and regional hydrology opens up serious questions about how the affected sectors of the economy and the water-dependent environmental assets can best adapt to the new, harsher climatic conditions. One of the possible approaches toward securing environmental water flows is to hold water rights on behalf of the public, and manage those rights for environmental purposes. This type of policy has been in effect in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, where the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) now has some 20% of all water rights in the basin. Thus far, the use of these water rights has been almost exclusively for environmental purposes, besides the calls for some of the allocations on these water rights to be sold to irrigators. This paper examines whether a change in policy that will allow a more flexible trading behavior of the CEWH so that it can be an active participant in the market for water allocations can help with adaptation to climate change from environmental management perspective, as well as from the perspective of irrigated agriculture industry. This objective is pursued by analyzing the effects of likely hydrological variations under climate change. Key parameters that are taken into account are expected water availability, and the variability in water availability. The discourse is framed within the concept of optimal allocation of water resources so as to maximize overall social benefit from water use. The results indicate that active participation of the CEWH in the water market leads to superior outcomes in terms of both greater overall social benefit, and greater quantity of water being available for environmental purposes under climate change. The key policy implication is that trading rules for CEWH should be relaxed, especially under the projected climate change scenarios.",10.1142/S2382624X15500162,Water Economics and Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

113,Social learning research in ecological economics: A survey,Siebenhuener et al.,2016-01-01,"Social learning studies emerged as part of the ecological economics research agenda rather recently. Questions of how human societies and organisations learn and transition on the basis of environmental knowledge relate to the core ideas of ecological economics with its pluralistic understanding of human behaviour in contrast to the limited focus on incentive-driven behaviour. Our study analyses the emergence and thematic foci of social learning studies within ecological economics over the past 15 years. We selected and analysed 54 articles published after peer review in established journals adhering to the epistemological tradition of ecological economics. This study is guided by the interest in how social learning is conceptualised, how this research is positioned in terms of process dynamics, causal factors and outcomes of learning. Results show, that the number of related papers grew substantially in recent years. Also the role of formal or informal institutions has been found to be a strong causal factor for social learning and change processes vis-A-vis technological, economic or political factors. In addition, there is a growing awareness of social learning processes in various environmental policy fields such as biodiversity governance, water and land management, fisheries, and climate adaptation. We conclude that these insights can give new impulses to research on socio-ecological transition and to the related debate on societal change and transformation processes as core topics for ecological economics.

Drawing upon social cognitive theory, this paper builds on the first author's Ph.D. dissertation and examines the role of collective efficacy people's shared beliefs about their group's capabilities to accomplish collective tasks in influencing Indians' capacity to adapt to drinking water scarcity, a condition likely to be exacerbated by future climate change. Using data from a national survey (N = 4031), individuals with robust collective efficacy beliefs were found to be more likely to participate in community activities intended to ensure the adequacy of water supplies, and this relationship was found to be stronger in communities with high levels of community collective efficacy compared to communities with low levels of community collective efficacy. In addition, community collective efficacy was positively associated with self-reported community adaptation responses. Public education campaigns aimed at increasing collective efficacy beliefs are likely to increase adaptive capacity.",10.1175/WCAS-D-14-00037.1,Weather Climate and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
115,Promoting Children's and Adolescents' Social and Emotional Development: District Adaptations of a Theory of Action,Kendziora and Osher,2016-01-01,"This article contributes to the broader discussion of promotion, prevention, and intervention in child and adolescent mental health by describing implementation and early outcomes of an 8-school district demonstration project aimed at making the promotion of social and emotional learning a systemic part of school districts' practice. Eight districts are 2-3 years in to their participation in the 6-year project. The districts are large, are predominantly urban, and serve many students who are at disadvantage. The evaluation involved collection of qualitative data to measure the degree to which the districts realized the goals established in the initiative's theory of action, as well as school climate data, extant student records, and surveys of students' social and emotional competence. To date, results show that districts have followed highly individual pathways toward integrating social and emotional learning systemically, and all have made progress over time. Although school-level implementation remains at moderate levels, 2 districts in which we could examine school climate showed gains from preinitiative years. Four of 6 measured districts showed improvement in social and emotional competence for students in Grade 3, and achievement and discipline showed overall improvements across all districts. Overall findings show that implementation of the initiative's theory of action by school districts is feasible, even in times of budgetary stress and leadership turnover. This establishes the potential for school districts to serve as a lever of change in the promotion of students' social and emotional development and mental wellness.",10.1080/15374416.2016.1197834,Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
116,Content Analysis of U.S. Local Adaptation Plans.xlsx,Woodruff,2016-01-01,"Purpose of the data: This data represents the content and quality of 44 local climate change adaptation plans in the United States. Climate change already affects local communities across the country, and these impacts are projected to become more severe and intense in the future. In response, many local communities are investing in adaptation - actions to limit the negative consequences of climate change - and, in many cases, creating climate adaptation plans. These plans detail how climate change is projected to impact the community and what actions should be taken to prepare. Adaptation planning represents systematic attention to climate change and, as a result, is expected to help prepare communities and lower the cost of climate-related impacts. This data represents how adaptation plans align with agreed-upon criteria of plan quality and allows users to identify specific strengths and areas for improvement. How this data was created: This data was created using a content analysis based plan evaluation. First, we developed a set of criteria corresponding to the plan quality characteristics based on existing planning guidance documents. Second, we created a sample of 44 local adaptation plans in the U.S. Third, we systematically read plans to identify whether they fulfill the specified criteria. Assessing the presence/absence of criteria allows the conversion of text to a quantitative measurement of plan quality, which eases comparisons between plans and permits statistical analyses. Finally, we used a grounded theory approach to analyze the text originally coded as strategies to ensure an accurate representation of adaptation strategies proposed by local governments in the sample. Researchers have used plan evaluation to analyze plans from multiple domains, including hazard mitigation, affordable housing, and sustainability planning. As plan quality evaluation has become more common, consensus has emerged on the core characteristics, or principles, of plan quality. Among these core characteristics are goals, fact base, policies, public participation in the planning process, and details concerning implementation and monitoring. These characteristics are applicable across planning domains and scales (e.g. municipal, county, state). When used effectively, plan quality evaluations can identify specific strengths and review the effectiveness of planning processes, providing the opportunity improve planning in the future. It is important to note that plan quality evaluation and plan quality guidance focus on plans themselves and not the outcomes plans produce. Coding protocol We developed a coding protocol to assess seven principles of plan quality: 1) goals, 2) fact base, 3) strategies, 4) public participation in plan creation, 5) inter-organizational coordination, 6) details regarding implementation and monitoring, and 7) how plans deal with uncertainty. To ensure that the protocol captured the most current theory on adaptation, metrics for each principle were based on an analysis of nine adaptation guidance documents published by international, federal, state, and non-governmental organizations. Despite the diversity in guidance documents considered, there was a high level of agreement on adaptation processes and factors that should be considered in climate adaptation planning. From this analysis, we extracted processes and considerations that are present across multiple adaptation guidance instruments and therefore could serve as evaluation metrics. In total, we developed a protocol with 124 metrics across the seven principles. A description of each metric and how it was applied in the coding process are provided in column B and C, respectively. The metrics pre-tested on eight local adaptation plans from Europe and Australia. The pre-testing allowed us to train the three coders and refine the metrics and coding instructions so that they captured the concepts intended. Sample Selection We selected plans to include in our sample based on three criteria: (1) the central topic of the plan was adaptation, resilience, or preparedness; (2) the plan was written by or for a U.S. city or county government; and (3) the plan took a comprehensive approach to adaptation by focusing on more than just one or two topics (i.e., we exclude sector-based adaptation plans). These criteria excluded plans that integrate adaptation components but do not focus entirely on adaptation (e.g., climate action plans and sustainability plans that dedicate a chapter to adaptation), plans that are written by regional entities (e.g., the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact), and plans that are written without local government involvement (e.g., plans written by local environmental non-profits). We evaluated all U.S. plans that we could find that met these criteria and were released between 2007, when Keene, NH published the first adaptation plan in the U.S., and 2014. We developed the sample based on a search of three adaptation clearinghouse websites: the Georgetown Climate Center, the Climate Adaptation Knowledge Exchange (CakeX), and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. In addition, we collected plans through three 100-page Google searches for the terms local adaptation plan, local resilience plan, and local preparedness plan. Coding Procedures Each plan was coded independently by two of the trained coders in line with recommendations from the communications literature on content analysis and recommendations from the plan evaluation literature on methodology. Before coding plans in the sample, we calculated inter-coder reliability to ensure that the coders fell within an appropriate range of inter-coder agreement (0.80 or greater). Coders used the NVivo version",http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3843444.v1,Figshare,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
117,Towards deliberative coastal governance: insights from South Africa and the Mississippi Delta,Glavovic,2016-01-01,"Coastal sustainability is elusive in South Africa and the Mississippi delta. These case studies and convergent literatures demonstrate the merits of reconceptualising coastal management as a transformative practice of deliberative governance. A normative framework is presented that focuses attention on underpinning deliberative outcomes to enable governance actors and networks to build cognitive, democratic, sociopolitical and institutional capacity to transform unsustainable and maladaptive coastal practices. But operationalising such intentions is complex and contested and requires a volte-face in thinking and practice. The South African and Mississippi delta experiences provide insights about how to develop a deliberative praxis of coastal governance based on consideration of the choice of process, timeliness, quality of process, equity and representation, connections to the policy cycle, impact, implementation and institutionalisation.",10.1007/s10113-014-0727-4,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
118,Community-based adaptation research in the Canadian Arctic,Ford et al.,2016-01-01,"Community-based adaptation (CBA) has emerged over the last decade as an approach to empowering communities to plan for and cope with the impacts of climate change. While such approaches have been widely advocated, few have critically examined the tensions and challenges that CBA brings. Responding to this gap, this article critically examines the use of CBA approaches with Inuit communities in Canada. We suggest that CBA holds significant promise to make adaptation research more democratic and responsive to local needs, providing a basis for developing locally appropriate adaptations based on local/indigenous and Western knowledge. Yet, we argue that CBA is not a panacea, and its common portrayal as such obscures its limitations, nuances, and challenges. Indeed, if uncritically adopted, CBA can potentially lead to maladaptation, may be inappropriate in some instances, can legitimize outside intervention and control, and may further marginalize communities. We identify responsibilities for researchers engaging in CBA work to manage these challenges, emphasizing the centrality of how knowledge is generated, the need for project flexibility and openness to change, and the importance of ensuring partnerships between researchers and communities are transparent. Researchers also need to be realistic about what CBA can achieve, and should not assume that research has a positive role to play in community adaptation just because it utilizes participatory approaches.

119,Modelling with stakeholders - Next generation,Voinov et al.,2016-01-01,"This paper updates and builds on 'Modelling with Stakeholders' Voinov and Bousquet, 2010 which demonstrated the importance of, and demand for, stakeholder participation in resource and environmental modelling. This position paper returns to the concepts of that publication and reviews the progress made since 2010. A new development is the wide introduction and acceptance of social media and web applications, which dramatically changes the context and scale of stakeholder interactions and participation. Technology advances make it easier to incorporate information in interactive formats via visualization and games to augment participatory experiences. Citizens as stakeholders are increasingly demanding to be engaged in planning decisions that affect them and their communities, at scales from local to global. How people interact with and access models and data is rapidly evolving. In turn, this requires changes in how models are built, packaged, and disseminated: citizens are less in awe of experts and external authorities, and they are increasingly aware of their own capabilities to provide inputs to planning processes, including models. The continued acceleration of environmental degradation and natural resource depletion accompanies these societal changes, even as there is a growing acceptance of the need to transition to alternative, possibly very different, life styles. Substantive transitions cannot occur without significant changes in human behaviour and perceptions. The important and diverse roles that models can play in guiding human behaviour, and in disseminating and increasing societal knowledge, are a feature of stakeholder processes today.

In this study, a nationally-representative sample of households in Niger is used to document how perceptions of 2007-2011 rainfall changes vary across households depending on their socio-economic characteristics and their location within the latitudinal rainfall gradient of the country. We further characterize the complex relationship between perceived rainfall trends and rainfall data derived from satellite data. We found that over the last five years, most people perceive less rainfall (76 %), worse distribution of rainfall in the year (78 %), more frequent droughts (83 %) and a rainy season delayed (71 %) and also finishing earlier (80 %). These perceptions are consistent with an observed worsening of rainfall conditions as seen from satellite data. Our results demonstrate that smallholders, commercial farmers, pastoralists and sedentary agro-pastoralists living in rural dry areas have a higher level of awareness of local changes than other respondents. Indeed, perceptions of these climate-sensitive households are more consensual and more closely related to observed local changes. We found that climate-sensitive households are able to detect very accurately changes in the beginning of the rainy season and to a lesser extent changes in rainfall distribution and drought frequency.",10.1007/s10584-015-1562-4,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
121,"Public Perception, Knowledge, and Participation in Climate Change Adaptation Governance in the Coastal Region of Bangladesh Using the Social Ecological Inventory (SEI) Tool",Bahauddin et al.,2016-01-01,"Public participation is commonly advocated for as part of policy responses to climate change. This study examines the prospects for inclusive approaches to climate change adaptation, drawing particularly on studies of long-term climate change adaptation in a coastal region in Bangladesh. It has been suggested that public perception, knowledge, and participation are important goals in the process of formulating response to climate change risks. This study found that local people as well as other stakeholders who participated in the study were more or less familiar with the term ""climate change."" However, the participants' understanding of what the term means and climate change's causes varied widely. The results also showed that a large number of the participants were uncertain about the solution to the climate change problems they are already experiencing, due to lack of accessible information from different governmental and non-governmental sources. It is notable that, despite being a country with a high level of political commitment to dealing with climate change, supported by plans, programs, and interventions, the people of Bangladesh are largely unaware of these efforts. This study explores the Social Ecological Inventory (SEI) tool as a means of managing the governance system for climate change adaptation in order to explore the public's perception of, knowledge about, and participation in developing adaptation plans. In this study, we used the SEI tool to systemically map the values, motives, activities, knowledge, and experiences of different actors over time and in different networks in order to prepare the ground for participation in developing climate change adaptation plans by helping identify and select the most appropriate set of actors to work with; build trust between these different actors; and, finally, reach a consensus among actors on how to enhance a region's sustainability and resilience.",10.1017/S1466046615000393,Environmental Practice,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Drawing upon literature of emotional geography, social dimensions of climate change, and public participation, this study illustrates the role of emotion in a public participation exercise in Londonderry, Vermont - a small town struggling to recover from Tropical Storm Irene. As a member of an interdisciplinary design team that facilitated a workshop on flood resilience and adaptive design in Londonderry, I witnessed an innovative exercise that employed storytelling, emotion, and body movement. This activity, which I term emotive-physical storytelling, created a foundation of trust and interpersonal connection that facilitators and residents built upon to plan for flood resiliency. Contrary to recent accounts of the ways that negative emotional responses can cause inaction in the face of climate change, this paper argues that creative public participation methods can generate positive emotions such as hope, responsibility, care, and solidarity. Such emotions have the potential to inspire adaptive action and produce transformative change.",http://dx.doi.org/10.7282/T3K64M5N,Rutgers University Community Repository,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Climate change projections indicate a considerable precipitation decrease in the broader basin area leading to river discharge loss the forthcoming decades. The study design accounted for preservation of current levels of different river services such as: irrigation, rafting activities, hydroelectricity power and ecological services. Our estimation strategy consisted in estimating a conditional logit model and a random parameters logit, together with their extended forms with census and attitudinal interacted variables. Results from all models present a tendency towards the selection of adaptation alternatives, showing that people are willing to pay for all river services except for rafting activities. Preferences' heterogeneity proves to be present and determinant, illustrating the choice patterns. The policy implications of these results may assist in developing more robust adaptation practises to cope with the socio-economic impacts of climate change on water resources.",10.1080/19443994.2014.984928,Desalination and Water Treatment,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
126,Modelling the influences of climate change-associated sea-level rise and socioeconomic development on future storm surge mortality,Lloyd et al.,2016-01-01,"Climate change is expected to affect health through changes in exposure to weather disasters. Vulnerability to coastal flooding has decreased in recent decades but remains disproportionately high in low-income countries. We developed a new statistical model for estimating future storm surge-attributable mortality. The model accounts for sea-level rise and socioeconomic change, and allows for an initial increase in risk as low-income countries develop. We used observed disaster mortality data to fit the model, splitting the dataset to allow the use of a longer time-series of high intensity, high mortality but infrequent events. The model could not be validated due to a lack of data. However, model fit suggests it may make reasonable estimates of log mortality risk but that mortality estimates are unreliable. We made future projections with and without climate change (A1B) and sea-based adaptation, but given the lack of model validation we interpret the results qualitatively. In low-income countries, risk initially increases with development up to mid-century before decreasing. If implemented, sea-based adaptation reduces climate-associated mortality in some regions, but in others mortality remains high. These patterns reinforce the importance of implementing disaster risk reduction strategies now. Further, while average mortality changes discontinuously over time, vulnerability and risk are evolving conditions of everyday life shaped by socioeconomic processes. Given this, and the apparent importance of socioeconomic factors that condition risk in our projections, we suggest future models should focus on estimating risk rather than mortality. This would strengthen the knowledge base for averting future storm surge-attributable health impacts.",10.1007/s10584-015-1376-4,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
127,Transformational responses to climate change: beyond a systems perspective of social change in mitigation and adaptation,Gillard et al.,2016-01-01,"There is a growing imperative for responses to climate change to go beyond incremental adjustments, aiming instead for society-wide transformation. In this context, sociotechnical (ST) transitions and social-ecological (SE) resilience are two prominent normative agendas. Reviewing these literatures reveals how both share a complex-systems epistemology with inherent limitations, often producing managerial governance recommendations and foregrounding material over social drivers of change. Further interdisciplinary dialogue with social theory is essential if these frameworks are to become more theoretically robust and capable of informing effective, let alone transformational, climate change governance. To illustrate this potential, ideas from Deleuze and Guattari's political writing as well as other approaches that utilize the notion social fields (as opposed to sociosystems) are combined to more fully theorize the origins and enactment of social change. First, the logic of systems is replaced with the contingency of assemblages to reveal how pluralism, not elitism, can produce more ambitious and politicized visions of the future. In particular, this view encourages us to see social and ecological tensions as opportunities for thinking and acting differently rather than as mere technical problems to be solved. Secondly, the setting of social fields is introduced to situate and explain the power of ideas and the role of agency in times of uncertainty. The potential of such insights is already visible in some strands of climate change mitigation and adaptation research, but more needs to be done to advance this field and to bring it into dialogue with the mainstream systems based literature.

129,Policy without politics: technocratic control of climate change adaptation policy making in Nepal,Ojha et al.,2016-01-01,"As developing countries around the world formulate policies to address climate change, concerns remain as to whether the voices of those most exposed to climate risk are represented in those policies. Developing countries face significant challenges for contextualizing global-scale scientific research into national political dynamics and downscaling global frameworks to sub-national levels, where the most affected are presumed to live. This article critiques the ways in which the politics of representation and climate science are framed and pursued in the process of climate policy development, and contributes to an understanding of the relative effectiveness of globally framed, generic policy mechanisms in vulnerable and politically volatile contexts. Based on this analysis, it also outlines opportunities for the possibility of improving climate policy processes to contest technocratic framing and generic international adaptation solutions. Policy relevance Nepal's position as one of the countries most at risk from climate change in the Himalayas has spurred significant international support to craft climate policy responses over the past few years. Focusing on the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and the Climate Change Policy, this article examines the extent to which internationally and scientifically framed climate policy in Nepal recognizes the unfolding political mobilizations around the demand for a representative state and equitable adaptation to climate risks. This is particularly important in Nepal, where political unrest in the post-conflict transition after the end of the civil war in 2006 has focused around struggles over representation for those historically on the political margins. Arguing that vulnerability to climate risk is produced in conjunction with social and political conditions, and that not everyone in the same locality is equally vulnerable, we demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of the politics of representation for climate policy making in Nepal. However, so far, this policy making has primarily been shaped through a technocratic framing that avoids political contestations and downplays the demand for inclusive and deliberative processes. Based on this analysis, we identify the need for a flexible, contextually grounded, and multi-scalar approach to political representation while also emphasizing the need for downscaling climate science that can inform policy development and implementation to achieve fair and effective adaptation to climate change.",10.1080/14693062.2014.1003775,Climate Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
130,NEW APPROACHES TO REVITALISE RURAL ECONOMIES AND COMMUNITIES - REFLECTIONS OF A POLICY ANALYST,Dwyer,2016-01-01,"Looking ahead, rural Europe faces significant challenges. Some of these are long-term and will require major adaptation, such as climate change, increasing scarcity of fossil fuels and the ageing indigenous population. Others are medium-term and subject to political uncertainty, such as economic stagnation and unemployment, pressures from in-migration, and constrained public finances. Markets appear likely to continue to encourage conventional farm modernisation and capitalization, but these may increase, rather than resolve, rural problems and tensions. Seen through an ecological lens, conventional patterns of development decrease rural social, environmental and economic resilience, and yet this is becoming increasingly important. New approaches are needed which can work with global and local processes to maintain rural diversity, quality and community: key factors in resilience-building. Interesting tactics may involve increasing local capacity to act, stimulating new local products, services and markets and new forms of pluri-activity.

Inadequate management may lead to water scarcity and ecological destruction, but also to an increase of catastrophic floods. With climate change, both water scarcity and the risk of flooding are likely to increase even further in the coming decades. This makes water management currently a highly dynamic field, in which experiments are made with new forms of policy making. In the current paper, a case study is presented in which different interest groups were invited for developing new water policy. The case was innovative in that stakeholders were invited to identify and frame the most urgent water issues, rather than asking them to reflect on possible solutions developed by the water authority itself. The case suggests that stakeholders can participate more effectively if their contribution is focused on underlying competing values rather than conflicting interests.",10.1007/s11948-015-9627-3,Science and Engineering Ethics,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
132,Metrics: moving beyond the adaptation information gap - introduction to the special issue,Wilder,2016-01-01,"This introduction to the special issue addresses the need to move beyond the adaptation information gap and the benefits and problems inherent in this move. It provides a background on this project and a brief review of the existing literature and recent advances in developing measurement and assessment instruments 'metrics' for the important guiding concepts of water security and adaptive capacity in water management. The review summarizes the promise and challenges encountered in the development and application of metrics and demonstrates that significant challenges remain in developing and applying metric instruments in real-world contexts, the most vexing being the lack of agreement on what model(s) to use and how to weight factors; the lack of evaluation of the validity and robustness of the instruments; the lack of consistency in analytical and application scales; deficits in engaging public participation in instrument design and use; and enduring tensions between contextualized and systematized knowledge, descriptive and predictive capabilities, and static and fluid data.",10.1016/j.cosust.2016.11.008,Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
133,Heatwave planning: community involvement in co-producing resilience,Fagan-Watson and Burchell,2016-01-01,"Drawing on a thematic analysis of relevant policy documents, an apparent disconnect is identified between two associated contemporary UK policy areas: planning for heatwaves and community resilience. Regional and national policy documents that plan for heatwaves in the UK tend to focus on institutional emergency responses and infrastructure development. In these documents, although communities are mentioned, they are understood as passive recipients of resilience that is provided by active institutions. Meanwhile, contemporary discussion about community resilience highlights the potential for involving communities in planning for and responding to emergencies (although the concept is also the subject of critique). To improve heatwave preparation, planning and response, more effort by central and local governments is required to articulate and realize greater participation by individuals, and voluntary and community sector groups.",10.1080/09613218.2016.1209626,Building Research and Information,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
134,Global megatrends and their implications for environmental assessment practice,Retief et al.,2016-01-01,"This paper addresses the future of environmental assessment (EA) practice in light of a rapidly changing world. We apply a literature review-based methodology to firstly identify key global megatrends and then reflect upon the implications for EA practice based on some known challenges. The key megatrends identified are synthesised into six categories: i) demographics, ii) urbanization, iii) technological innovation, iv) power shifts, v) resource scarcity and vi) climate change. We then discuss the implications of these megatrends for EA practice against four known EA challenges namely: dealing with i) complexity and uncertainty, ii) efficiency, iii) significance and iv) communication and participation. Our analysis suggests important implications for EA practice such as: increased difficulties with accuracy of prediction; the need for facilitative adaptation; an increase in the occurrence of unexpected events; higher expectations for procedural efficiency; challenges with information and communication management; dealing with significance judgements; and mitigation amidst resource scarcity and increasing pressures on earth systems. The megatrends underscore the need for continued evolution of EA thinking and practice, especially moving away from seeking a predictable single future or outcome towards the possibility of multiple scenarios with associated adaptability and enhanced system resilience capable of responding to rapid change.

135,"An indicator-based approach to assess village-level social and biophysical vulnerability of agriculture communities in Uttarakhand, India",Shukla et al.,2016-01-01,"With the growing recognition to myriad forms of current and future threats in the mountain agriculture systems, there is a pressing need to holistically understand the vulnerability of mountain agriculture communities. The study aims to assess the biophysical and social vulnerability of agriculture communities using an indicator-based approach for the state of Uttarakhand, India. A total of 14 indicators were used to capture biophysical vulnerability and 22 for social vulnerability profiles of 15285 villages. Vulnerability analysis was done at village level with weights assigned to each indicator using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results of the study highlight the presence of very high biophysical vulnerability (0.82 +/- 0.10) and high social vulnerability (0.65 +/- 0.15) within the state. Based on the results, it was found that incidences of high biophysical vulnerability coincide with presence of intensified agriculture land and absence of dense forest. Higher social vulnerability scores were found in villages with an absence of local institutions (like Self Helping Groups (SHGs)), negligible infrastructure facilities and higher occupational dependence on agriculture. A contrast was observed in the vulnerability scores of villages present in the three different altitudinal zones in the study area, indicating respective vulnerability generating conditions existing in these three zones. Biophysical vulnerability was recorded to be highest in the villages falling in the lower zone and lowest in the upper zone villages; whereas, social vulnerability was found to be highest in the middle zone villages and lowest in lower zone villages. Our study aids policy makers in identifying areas for intervention to expedite agriculture adaptation planning in the state. Additionally, the adaptation programmes in the region need to be more context-specific to accommodate the differential altitudinal vulnerability profiles.",10.1007/s11629-016-4058-4,Journal of Mountain Science,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
136,Ten Thousand Voices on Marine Climate Change in Europe: Different Perceptions among Demographic Groups and Nationalities,Buckley et al.,2017-01-01,"Over the past few decades, substantial funding has been directed toward improving scientific understanding and management of impacts of climate change in the marine environment. Following concerns that the key messages from these studies were not reaching the public, a comprehensive opinion poll of 10,000 European citizens in 10 countries was conducted to establish levels of awareness, concern, and trust among different demographic groups (by age, gender, proximity to the coast) and nationalities. Citizens exhibited varying levels of self-declared ""informedness"" and concern. Citizens from Germany, Italy and Spain claimed to be the most informed on marine climate change issues; those from Czech Republic, Netherlands and Estonia claimed to be least informed. Respondents were least aware of ocean acidification and most aware of melting sea ice, pollution and overfishing. Citizens of Italy suggested that they were generally most concerned about marine climate change issues. Respondents from coastal areas claimed to be both more informed and more concerned than those living inland, as did females and older age groups (54-64 years). European citizens obtain information about climate change in the seas and ocean from different sources, particularly television and the internet. Trust in the various media sources varies among countries and demographic groups. Television is trusted most in Estonia, Germany and Ireland and least in France. The internet is trusted most in Italy, Czech Republic and Estonia, but least in France and the United Kingdom. 18-24 year olds are the biggest users of the internet, but trust this source less than older age groups. Academic scientists or those working for environmental NGOs are trusted more than scientists working for government or industry. Citizens from France are more trusting of industry than any other country polled. In terms of policy actions, most respondents highlighted mitigation measures as opposed to local-scale adaptation. Younger participants prioritized actions associated with reducing carbon emissions, whereas older age groups prioritized improving coastal defenses. Successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change requires public engagement and support for policy decisions, and the use of different approaches to take account of differences among demographic groups and nationalities.",10.3389/fmars.2017.00206,Frontiers in Marine Science,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
137,"Towards Adaptation to Climate Change: Water for Rice in the Coastal Wetlands of Donana, Southern Spain",Iglesias et al.,2017-01-01,"Rice production in coastal wetlands provides critical ecosystem services that range from flood control to wildlife habitat. In the Iberian Peninsula rice was introduced in the 10th Century. Today Iberian rice accounts for about one quarter of the total rice production of the European Union, almost exclusively cultivated in the coastal wetlands of Spain, with permanent flooding. The intensive water management required to produce rice stands at a crucial point since freshwater supply is deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. Here we explore flexible adaptation options to climate change in the Doana wetlands - a world heritage and biodiversity site - from two points of view: What are the policy options for agricultural water management in view of climate change? How can informed stakeholders contribute to better adaptation? The first question is addressed by simulating water availability to farmers with the WAAPA model under a range of adaptation policy options derived from the view of the local communities. The second question was addressed by means of participatory research. Adaptation options are framed according to the local environmental, social and policy context. Results suggest that perception on the potential role of new water infrastructure and farming subsidies dominates the view of local communities. The choices of the stakeholders that could be simulated with the hydrological model, were quantified in terms of additional water availability for the rice farming, therefore providing a quantitative measure to the qualitative solutions. Information provided during the study shaped the final adaptation options developed. Our research contributes to the definition of sustainable rice production in Europe.",10.1007/s11269-015-0995-x,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
138,Evaluation of Socio-Economic Factors that Determine Adoption of Climate Compatible Freshwater Supply Measures at Farm Level: a Case Study in the Southwest Netherlands,Veraart et al.,2017-01-01,"The availability of freshwater resources in soil and groundwater bodies in the southwestern part of The Netherlands is expected to decrease during the agricultural growing season because of an expected increase of freshwater demands and a changing climate. This expected shortage of fresh water might negatively affect agricultural production. To cope with this problem, three pilots were initiated aimed at increasing freshwater supply at farm-level. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the socio-economic factors that determine the wider use of the measures investigated in these pilots. Therefore, the results of a feasibility study and a survey about drought risks were compared. The survey indicates that respondents do not make distinction between a dry and extremely dry year in their estimation of the return period. The results of a feasibility study illustrate that confidence and the level of common understanding regarding the reliability of these innovative measures has increased amongst project participants since 2012. The survey respondents were less optimistic about the wider implementation of the investigated technologies. A reliable freshwater supply and supportive legislation are the most decisive socio-economic factors for a future investment in additional freshwater supply for farmers in this region. Both studies illustrate that the impact of additional freshwater supply on farm economics strongly depends on farm type and crop cultivation plan. These insights may support the wider use of these innovations and may help to improve agro-hydrological models.",10.1007/s11269-016-1399-2,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
139,Source-Based Modeling Of Urban Stormwater Quality Response to the Selected Scenarios Combining Future Changes in Climate and Socio-Economic Factors,Borris et al.,2016-01-01,"The assessment of future trends in urban stormwater quality should be most helpful for ensuring the effectiveness of the existing stormwater quality infrastructure in the future and mitigating the associated impacts on receiving waters. Combined effects of expected changes in climate and socio-economic factors on stormwater quality were examined in two urban test catchments by applying a source-based computer model (WinSLAMM) for TSS and three heavy metals (copper, lead, and zinc) for various future scenarios. Generally, both catchments showed similar responses to the future scenarios and pollutant loads were generally more sensitive to changes in socio-economic factors (i.e., increasing traffic intensities, growth and intensification of the individual land-uses) than in the climate. Specifically, for the selected Intermediate socio-economic scenario and two climate change scenarios (RSP = 2.6 and 8.5), the TSS loads from both catchments increased by about 10 % on average, but when applying the Intermediate climate change scenario (RCP = 4.5) for two SSPs, the Sustainability and Security scenarios (SSP1 and SSP3), the TSS loads increased on average by 70 %. Furthermore, it was observed that well-designed and maintained stormwater treatment facilities targeting local pollution hotspots exhibited the potential to significantly improve stormwater quality, however, at potentially high costs. In fact, it was possible to reduce pollutant loads from both catchments under the future Sustainability scenario (on average, e.g., TSS were reduced by 20 %), compared to the current conditions. The methodology developed in this study was found useful for planning climate change adaptation strategies in the context of local conditions.",10.1007/s00267-016-0705-3,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
140,Farming adaptation to environmental change in coastal Bangladesh: shrimp culture versus crop diversification,Kabir et al.,2016-01-01,"Farming in coastal Bangladesh includes rice/shrimp and rice/non-rice cropping systems. The former has been highly profitable but has exacerbated salinization of soil and water. We evaluate the relative profitability, riskiness, and sustainability of the two cropping systems, using data from two coastal villages in Khulna District. Shrimp cultivation was initially very rewarding. However, over 12-15 years, the cropping system experienced declining profitability, increased salinity, and adverse impacts on rice cropping and the local environment. From 2009, farmers adapted the system by changing the pond (gher) infrastructure, adopting delayed planting of a saline-tolerant rice cultivar, flushing out accumulated salt with freshwater during rice cropping, and allowing the soil to dry out after harvesting rice. The budgeting results show that with current management practices, the rice/shrimp system is economically more viable (higher returns to land and labour and less risky) than the rice/non-rice system. Soil analyses showed that while salinity was higher in the gher during the dry season, it was significantly reduced in the wet season and was very similar between the two systems (1-2 dS/m). Hence, as well as being more profitable and less risky, the rice/shrimp system may well be more sustainable than previously observed.",10.1007/s10668-015-9697-z,Environment Development and Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
141,"Metrics for assessing adaptive capacity and water security: common challenges, diverging contexts, emerging consensus",Garfin et al.,2016-01-01,"The rapid pace of climate and environmental changes requires some degree of adaptation, to forestall or avoid severe impacts. Adaptive capacity and water security are concepts used to guide the ways in which resource managers plan for and manage change. Yet the assessment of adaptive capacity and water security remains elusive, due to flaws in guiding concepts, paucity or inadequacy of data, and multiple difficulties in measuring the effectiveness of management prescriptions at scales relevant to decision-making. We draw on conceptual framings and empirical findings of the thirteen articles in this special issue and seek to respond to key questions with respect to metrics for the measurement, governance, information accessibility, and robustness of the knowledge produced in conjunction with ideas related to adaptive capacity and water security. Three overarching conclusions from this body of work are (a) systematic cross comparisons of metrics, using the same models and indicators, are needed to validate the reliability of evaluation instruments for adaptive capacity and water security, (b) the robustness of metrics to applications across multiple scales of analysis can be enhanced by a 'metrics plus' approach that combines well-designed quantitative metrics with in-depth qualitative methods that provide rich context and local knowledge, and (c) changes in the governance of science policy can address deficits in public participation, foster knowledge exchange, and encourage the co-development of adaptive processes and approaches (e.g., risk-based framing) that move beyond development and use of static indicators and metrics.",10.1016/j.cosust.2016.11.007,Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
142,Dealing with Uncertainties in Fresh Water Supply: Experiences in the Netherlands,Thissen et al.,2017-01-01,"Developing fresh water supply strategies for the long term needs to take into account the fact that the future is deeply uncertain. Not only the extent of climate change and the extent and nature of its impacts are unknown, also socio-economic conditions may change in unpredictable ways, as well as social preferences. Often, it is not possible to find solid ground for estimating probabilities for the relevant range of imaginable possible future developments. Yet, some of these may have profound impacts and consequences for society which could be reduced by timely proactive adaptation. In response to these and similar challenges, various approaches, methods and techniques have been proposed and are being developed to specifically address long-term strategy development under so-called deep uncertainty. This paper, first, offers a brief overview of developments in the field of planning under (deep) uncertainty. Next, we illustrate application of three different approaches to fresh water provision planning under uncertainty in case studies in the Netherlands: a resilience approach, oriented to (re) designing fresh water systems in such a way that they will be less vulnerable, resp. will be able to recover easily from future disturbances; a robustness approach, oriented to quantitative assessment of system performance for various system configurations (adaptation options) under a range of external disturbances, and an exploratory modeling approach, developed to explore policy effectiveness and system operation under a very wide set of assumptions about future conditions.",10.1007/s11269-015-1198-1,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
143,Combined Assessment of Climate Change and Socio-Economic Development as Drivers of Freshwater Availability in the South of Portugal,Stigter et al.,2017-01-01,"A combined assessment of the potential impacts from climate change (CC) and socio-economic development (SED) on water resources is presented for the most important aquifer in the south of Portugal. The goal is to understand how CC and SED affect the currently large pressures from water consuming and contaminating activities, predominantly agriculture. Short-term (2020-2050) and long-term (2070-2100) CC scenarios were developed and used to build aquifer recharge and crop water demand scenarios, using different methods to account for uncertainty. SED scenarios were developed using bottom-up and top-down methods, and discussed at workshops with farmers and institutional stakeholders in the water sector. Groundwater use was quantified for each scenario. Together with the recharge scenarios, these were run through a calibrated groundwater flow model, to study their individual and joint impacts on groundwater levels and discharge rates into a coastal estuary. Recharge scenarios show clear negative long-term trends and short-term increase in temporal variability of recharge, though short-term model uncertainties are higher. SED scenario 1 (SED1), predicting intensification and decline of small farms, considered the most likely by all workshop participants, shows a large drop in agricultural area and water demand. SED2, a most desired scenario by farmers, foresees growth and modernization of agriculture, but proves unsustainable in combination with predicted CC without efficient adaptation measures. The results thus reveal that CC in the region will dynamically interact with economic factors, and going one step beyond,",10.1007/s11269-015-0994-y,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
144,Perceptions of Environmental Change and Climate Concern Among Idaho's Farmers,Running et al.,2017-01-01,"Climate change public opinion research has identified conservative political ideology as the primary predictor of skepticism about climate change's anthropogenic causes. Most farmers in Idaho are politically conservative, but they are also a unique group for whom observing their environment is part of daily life and work. We use data from in-depth interviews with 30 Idaho farmers to examine the relationship between observations of specific environmental changes and climate concern. We find that while most farmers report noticing changes in precipitation patterns, growing season length, and winter temperatures, few farmers connect these with long-term global climate change. These findings have two important implications: 1) direct experience, even in the form of disruption to an individual's economic security, is not enough to overcome the influence of political ideology on climate change beliefs, and 2) acknowledging climate variation is not sufficient to convince individuals that the changes are produced by human activities.",10.1080/08941920.2016.1239151,Society & Natural Resources,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
145,Social Sustainability: A New Conceptual Framework,Eizenberg and Jabareen,2017-01-01,"There is a lack of theoretical and empirical studies regarding social sustainability. The literature reveals that the ""social"" was integrated late into debates on sustainable development. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new conceptual framework of social sustainability. We suggest that risk is a constitutive concept of sustainability and that the contemporary conditions of risk resulting primarily from climate change and its ensuing uncertainties pose serious social, spatial, structural, and physical threats to contemporary human societies and their living spaces. Within the framework of sustainability, we propose that social sustainability strives to confront risk while addressing social concerns. Although we agree that without socially oriented practices, efforts to achieve sustainability will be undermined, as too many gaps exist in practice and theory. Thus, we propose a comprehensive Conceptual Framework of Social Sustainability, which is composed of four interrelated concepts of socially oriented practices, where each concept has a distinctive function in the framework and incorporates major social aspects. The concept of Equity encompasses three dimensions: recognition, which "" revalues unjustly devalued identities"", redistribution, which suggests that the remedy for injustice is some form of economic restructuring, and parity of participation, which promotes substantive public involvement in the production of space. These efforts may, in turn, reduce alienation and enhance civility and a sense of community and place attachment. The concept of Safety is the ontological foundation of sustainability in general and social sustainability in particular. The concept refers to the right to not only be safe but adopt all measures of adaptation and security to prevent future casualties and physical harm. The concept of Eco-prosumption refers to modes of producing and gaining values in socially and environmentally responsible ways. The concept of Urban Forms represents the physical dimensions of socially desired urban and community physical forms. Eventually, a desired physical form should promote a sense of community, safety, health, and place attachment, among other environmental objectives.",10.3390/su9010068,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
146,Wood-based bioenergy in western Montana: the importance of understanding path dependence and local context for resilience,Beeton and Galvin,2017-01-01,"3 The use of biomass for wood-based bioenergy (WBB) has been argued as a mechanism to mitigate the impacts of climate change, reduce vulnerability to disturbance events such as fires, and to enhance rural socioeconomic development. Yet, WBB development is characterized by a multitude of feedstock sources, bioenergy pathways, scales, and end uses, the feasibility of which is contingent upon place-based and context-specific social and environmental factors. We present an exploratory case study that draws on key informant interviews among a cohort of diverse stakeholders in rural western Montana forest communities, which was informed by a social-ecological systems framework and resilience thinking from a social science lens. The purpose of this paper is the following: (a) to document the ways in which key informants define the opportunities and constraints associated with WBB in local contexts; and (b) to understand how, and under what contexts, WBB can contribute to forest and community resilience under change. Interviews were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach, and supplemented by document analysis. Results illustrate the ways in which historical contingencies (i.e., path dependence), individual and group values, and social context can affect the capacity to implement WBB projects. Results also help identify multiple perspectives and trade-offs, which can provide a step toward identifying the most desirable and plausible options for WBB development. As such, these lessons can be used as a starting point to help determine WBB development pathways that contribute to the social and ecological resilience of local places and people under change.",10.5751/ES-09157-220209,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
147,Balancing stability and flexibility in adaptive governance: an analysis of tools available in US environmental law,Craig et al.,2017-01-01,"Adaptive governance must work ""on the ground,"" that is, it must operate through structures and procedures that the people it governs perceive to be legitimate and fair, as well as incorporating processes and substantive goals that are effective in allowing social-ecological systems (SESs) to adapt to climate change and other impacts. To address the continuing and accelerating alterations that climate change is bringing to SESs, adaptive governance generally will require more flexibility than prior governance institutions have often allowed. However, to function as good governance, adaptive governance must pay real attention to the problem of how to balance this increased need for flexibility with continuing governance stability so that it can foster adaptation to change without being perceived or experienced as perpetually destabilizing, disruptive, and unfair. Flexibility and stability serve different purposes in governance, and a variety of tools exist to strike different balances between them while still preserving the governance institution's legitimacy among the people governed. After reviewing those purposes and the implications of climate change for environmental governance, we examine psychological insights into the structuring of adaptive governance and the variety of legal tools available to incorporate those insights into adaptive governance regimes. Because the substantive goals of governance systems will differ among specific systems, we do not purport to comment on what the normative or substantive goals of law should be. Instead, we conclude that attention to process and procedure (including participation), as well as increased use of substantive standards (instead of rules), may allow an increased level of substantive flexibility to operate with legitimacy and fairness, providing the requisite levels of psychological, social, and economic stability needed for communities to adapt successfully to the Anthropocene.",10.5751/ES-08983-220203,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
148,Applying information network analysis to fire-prone landscapes: implications for community resilience,Jacobs and Cramer,2017-01-01,"Resilient communities promote trust, have well-developed networks, and can adapt to change. For rural communities in fire-prone landscapes, current resilience strategies may prove insufficient in light of increasing wildfire risks due to climate change. It is argued that, given the complexity of climate change, adaptations are best addressed at local levels where specific social, cultural, political, and economic conditions are matched with local risks and opportunities. Despite the importance of social networks as key attributes of community resilience, research using social network analysis on coupled human and natural systems is scarce. Furthermore, the extent to which local communities in fire-prone areas understand climate change risks, accept the likelihood of potential changes, and have the capacity to develop collaborative mitigation strategies is underexamined, yet these factors are imperative to community resiliency. We apply a social network framework to examine information networks that affect perceptions of wildfire and climate change in Central Oregon. Data were collected using a mailed questionnaire. Analysis focused on the residents' information networks that are used to gain awareness of governmental activities and measures of community social capital. A two-mode network analysis was used to uncover information exchanges. Results suggest that the general public develops perceptions about climate change based on complex social and cultural systems rather than as patrons of scientific inquiry and understanding. It appears that perceptions about climate change itself may not be the limiting factor in these communities' adaptive capacity, but rather how they perceive local risks. We provide a novel methodological approach in understanding rural community adaptation and resilience in fire-prone landscapes and offer a framework for future studies.",10.5751/ES-09119-220152,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
149,Understanding and applying principles of social cognition and decision making in adaptive environmental governance,DeCaro et al.,2017-01-01,"Environmental governance systems are under greater pressure to adapt and to cope with increased social and ecological uncertainty from stressors like climate change. We review principles of social cognition and decision making that shape and constrain how environmental governance systems adapt. We focus primarily on the interplay between key decision makers in society and legal systems. We argue that adaptive governance must overcome three cooperative dilemmas to facilitate adaptation: (1) encouraging collaborative problem solving, (2) garnering social acceptance and commitment, and (3) cultivating a culture of trust and tolerance for change and uncertainty. However, to do so governance systems must cope with biases in people's decision making that cloud their judgment and create conflict. These systems must also satisfy people's fundamental needs for self-determination, fairness, and security, ensuring that changes to environmental governance are perceived as legitimate, trustworthy, and acceptable. We discuss the implications of these principles for common governance solutions (e.g., public participation, enforcement) and conclude with methodological recommendations. We outline how scholars can investigate the social cognitive principles involved in cases of adaptive governance.",10.5751/ES-09154-220133,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
150,Slum Upgrading and Health Equity,Corburn and Sverdlik,2017-01-01,"Informal settlement upgrading is widely recognized for enhancing shelter and promoting economic development, yet its potential to improve health equity is usually overlooked. Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asia, Africa and Latin America and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits.",10.3390/ijerph14040342,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

This study assesses the main drivers of vulnerability and livelihood cycle of vulnerable riparian households in Bangladesh. The study utilises the IPCC framework of vulnerability and develops a weighted approach by employing the livelihood vulnerability index and the climate vulnerability index. The results reveal that the livelihood vulnerability index and the climate vulnerability index differ across locations, however, a high index value for both measures indicates the households' high livelihood vulnerability to climate change and hazards. The main drivers that influence the vulnerability dimensions are livelihood strategies and access to food, water and health facilities. These hazard-prone households are also vulnerable due to their existing low livelihood status that leads to a vicious cycle of poverty. The findings of this study are crucial for policymakers to formulate and implement effective strategies and programs to minimise vulnerability and to enhance the local adaptation processes in order to improve such households' livelihood across Bangladesh.",10.1007/s00267-017-0826-3,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

153,Governing Climate Change Risks: Subnational Climate Policies in Brazil,Barbi and Ferreira,2017-01-01,"Subnational governments play a key role producing responses to climate change risks involving policy strategies and instruments. This article analyzes how Brazilian municipal and state governments have developed and implemented climate change mitigation and adaptation public policies. We surveyed all cities' and states' climate policies within the country. The methodological approach includes five main points of analysis: (1) mitigation targets and intentions; (2) adaptation actions; (3) stakeholders' participation; (4) policy implementation; (5) participation in climate change transnational networks. Our results showed that even though subnational climate policies are isolated initiatives in the country, they are relevant initiatives to respond to climate change risks in different scales and levels. The solidest subnational policies emerged where there were previous institutional arrangements related to climate change including the participation of several stakeholders. Such governments have also joined transnational climate change cooperation networks.",10.1007/s41111-017-0061-3,Chinese Political Science Review,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
154,The Roles of Residents in Climate Adaptation: A systematic review in the case of the Netherlands,Hegger et al.,2017-01-01,"Climate adaptation literature has hitherto devoted limited attention to the roles of residents. Yet their role is crucial in addressing non- or maladaptation, as their initiative or consent is often necessary to take adaptation measures in or around the house. To address this knowledge gap, this paper explores mainstream and additional roles for residents through a literature review. Mainstream roles are those roles that residents usually take, while additional roles are more specific and local in nature. The latter may, however, provide the seeds for wider change. To structure the results, we made a distinction between three forms of residents' commitment to adaptation: as (1) citizens falling under the jurisdiction of various governmental levels; (2) consumers (including home owners) in the market; and (3) civil society members/partners. While this is an established categorization in other domains of environmental governance, it has not yet been systematically applied to the adaptation domain. The paper's empirical focus regarding mainstream and additional roles is on the Dutch adaptation domains of flood risk management, stormwater management and dealing with heat stress. We found scope for additional roles for residents, especially as consumers in the market and civil society members. The findings are of significance for the global debate on residents' roles in climate adaptation and suggest that addressing all three forms of commitment may enhance the implementation of measures as well as their legitimacy, residents' awareness and societies' potential to innovate.

155,Researching climate change and community in neoliberal contexts: an emerging critical approach,Aiken et al.,2017-01-01,"In a 2011 contribution to this journal, Walker examined the ways that community is routinely employed in carbon governance, suggesting the need for more critical approaches. Here, we characterize an emerging, critical approach to researching climate change and community in neoliberal contexts, focusing attention principally on the global north, where this body of research has emerged. This work recognizes communities as sites of contestation, difference, tension, and distinction, in which action on climate change can be designed to meet a range of political and public ends. It aims to uncover the political and social context for community action on climate change, to be alert to the power relations inside and outside of communities, and to the context of neoliberalism, including individualism, the will to quantify, and competition. Furthermore, research in this space is committed to understanding both the lived experience of the messy empirical worlds we encounter, and the potential agency coalescing in community responses to climate change. Much of the work to date, discussed here, has focused on communities working on climate change mitigation in the global north, in which the idea of community as a space for governance is gaining traction. We also comment on the positioning of these arguments in the context of long-standing debates in the fields of community-based' development, natural resource management, and adaptation in the global South. This discussion establishes a foundation from which to progress learning across fields and geopolitical boundaries, furthering critical thinking on community.'

156,"A globally deployable strategy for co-development of adaptation preferences to sea-level rise: the public participation case of Santos, Brazil",Marengo et al.,2017-01-01,"Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a range of threats to natural and built environments in coastal zones around the world. Assessment of the risks due to exposure and sensitivity of coastal communities to coastal flooding is essential for informed decision-making. Strategies for public understanding and awareness of the tangible effects of climate change are fundamental in developing policy options. A multidisciplinary, multinational team of natural and social scientists from the USA, the UK, and Brazil developed the METROPOLE Project to evaluate how local governments may decide between adaptation options associated with SLR projections. METROPOLE developed a participatory approach in which public actors engage fully in defining the research problem and evaluating outcomes. Using a case study of the city of Santos, in Brazil, METROPOLE developed a method for evaluating risks jointly with the community, comparing 'no-action' to 'adaptation' scenarios. At the core of the analysis are estimates of economic costs of the impact of floods on urban real estate under SLR projections through 2050 and 2100. Results helped identify broad preferences and orientations in adaptation planning, which the community, including the Santos municipal government, co-developed in a joint effort with natural and social scientists.",10.1007/s11069-017-2855-x,Natural Hazards,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
157,Role of community based local institution for climate change adaptation in the Teesta riverine area of Bangladesh,Karim and Thiel,2017-01-01,"Climate change adaptation is one of the most crucial issues in developing countries like Bangladesh. The main objective was to understand the linkage of participation with Community Based Adaptation (CBA) to climate change. Institutional framework following different types of conceptual theories (collective action, group, game and social learning theory) was utilized to analyze the participatory process in local community level Village Disaster Mangement Committee (VDMC) that works in collaboration with local government. Field level data was collected through interview and group discussion during 25 April to 30 May 2015 in the Teesta riverine area of northern Bangladesh. Results showed that flood and drought were the major climate change impacts in the study area, and various participatory tools were used for risk assessment and undertaking action plans to overcome the climate change challenges by the group VDMC. Participation in VDMC generated both relational and technical outcomes. The relational outcomes are the informal institutional changes through which local community adopt technological adaptation measures. Although, limitations like bargaining problem, free riding or conflict were found in collective decision making, but the initiation of local governance like VDMC has brought various institutional change in the communities in terms of adaptation practices. More than 80% VDMC and around 40-55% non-VDMC household respondents agreed that overall community based adaptation process was successful in the previous year. They believed that some innovative practices had been brought in the community through VDMC action for climate change adaptation. No doubt that the CBA has achieved good progress to achieve the government Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM) strategy of climate change adaptation. But, there is still lack of coordination among local government, NGOs and civil partners in working together. Research related to socio-economic impact analysis for the sustainability of adaptation measures implemented through local community could be undertaken in future. (C) 2017 The Authors.

158,What does resilience mean for urban water services?,Johannessen and Wamsler,2017-01-01,"Disasters and climate change impacts, as well as increased water demand, pose serious risks to the provision of sustainable urban water services, e.g., drinking water, sanitation, and safe drainage, especially in cities. These challenges call for a transition toward improved water management, including considerations of ""resilience."" However, because the resilience concept has multidisciplinary origins it is open to multiple interpretations, which poses a challenge to understanding and operationalizing the concept. We explore how resilience thinking can be translated into urban water practice to develop the conceptual understanding of transitions toward sustainability. The study is based on a literature review, interviews with water experts, as well as four case studies in South Africa, India, Sweden, and the Philippines. We identify seven key principles or attributes of urban water resilience and the related transition process. We find that resilience building needs to discern between and manage three levels (i.e., socioeconomic, external hazard considerations, and larger social-ecological systems) to be sustainable. In addition, we find that human agency is a strong driver of transition processes, with a certain level of risk awareness and risk perception providing one threshold and a certain capacity for action to implement measures and reorganize in response to risks being another. The difficulty of achieving ""knowledge to action"" derives from the multiple challenges of crossing these two types of identified thresholds. To address long-term trends or stressors, we find an important role for social learning to ensure that the carrying capacity of urban water services is not exceeded or unwanted consequences are created (e.g., long-term trends like salinization and water depletion). We conclude that the resilience term and related concepts add value to understanding and addressing the dynamic dimension of urban water transitions if the key principles identified in this study are considered.",10.5751/ES-08870-220101,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
159,Does the perception of climate change vary with the socio-demographic dimensions? A study on vulnerable populations in Bangladesh,Haq and Ahmed,2017-01-01,"This study tried to explore the perception of climate change by considering the socio-demographic dimensions of vulnerable populations in Bangladesh. This study included 158 respondents from an extremely flood affected area of Sylhet by using multistage sampling. This study used both quantitative and qualitative method to analyze data. Using several statistical tools and doing paraphrased translation of key information, this study find that the perception of climate change varies depending on the different socio-demographic dimensions such as gender, marital status, religion and age. Findings also show that the concern about climate change and the reasons for it as well as the prospective solutions and pathways to reduce its impacts are present in different socio-demographic dimensions. This study particularly reveals that the majority of the populations consider the reason of climate change from sinful activities of the individuals and wish of God. Other, however, considers that deforestation and river dredging are the reasons of climate change. And most people perceive that increasing education on the environment, changing human behavior and community level participation, can lead to reduce the adverse situations of climate change in developing countries like Bangladesh.",10.1007/s11069-016-2664-7,Natural Hazards,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
160,System Dynamics Evaluation of Climate Change Adaptation Strategies for Water Resources Management in Central Iran,Gohari et al.,2017-01-01,"The Zayandeh-Rud River basin, Iran, is projected to face spatiotemporally heterogeneous temperature increase and precipitation reduction that will decrease water supply by mid-century. With projected increase (0.70-1.03 degrees C) in spring temperature and reduction (6-55%) in winter precipitation, the upper Zayandeh-Rud sub-basin, the main source of renewable water supply, will likely become warmer and drier. In the lower sub-basin, 1.1-1.5 degrees C increase in temperature and 11-31% decrease in annual precipitation are likely. A system dynamics model was used to analyze adaptation strategies taking into account feedbacks between water resources development and biophysical and socioeconomic sub-systems. Results suggest that infrastructural improvements, rigorous water demand management (e.g., replacing high water demand crops such as rice, corn, and alfalfa), and ecosystem-based regulatory prioritization, complemented by supply augmentation can temporarily alleviate water stress in a basin that is essentially governed by the Limits to Growth archetype.",10.1007/s11269-017-1575-z,Water Resources Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
161,Policy Analysis to Reduce Climate Change-Induced Risks in Urban and Rural Areas in Korea,Moon et al.,2017-01-01,"The purpose of this paper was to project changes in climate change-induced risks over time and to investigate policy alternatives to mitigate the risks from increases in sea level, heavy rains, and heat waves in urban and rural areas. System dynamics simulation was used to build a model and conduct policy analysis for a simulation period over the years 2000-2050. The model was built with a focus on the interaction among three factors: damage restoration costs from heavy rains, heat waves, and sea level rise; the total cost of food imports due to decreases in arable land and agricultural productivity; and changes in the government budget to respond to climate change problems. A policy experiment was conducted with the model under four scenarios mainly based on the government budget for climate change. The results indicated, firstly, that the climate budget needs to be increased to at least 13 trillion KoreanWon (US $11.6 billion) per year. Secondly, an earlier budget increase would more effectively reduce the total disaster restoration cost than a delayed budget increase. Third, if an earlier budget increase is difficult, the next best alternative would be to allocate a greater fraction of the climate budget to urban rather than to rural areas. Lastly, an early response to climate change would more effectively reduce food import costs, maintain agricultural productivity, and improve infrastructure for climate change adaptation than a delayed response. In conclusion, an earlier increase in the climate change budget would be more effective than a delayed budget increase of the same amount, and allocating a larger fraction of the climate budget to urban areas could be more cost-effective than increasing the budget, if urban and rural parties could agree on the method of allocation.",10.3390/su9040524,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
162,Cultural resources and public trust shape attitudes toward climate change and preferred futures-A case study among the Norwegian public,Kaltenborn et al.,2017-01-01,"Since climate change mitigation likely will affect most sectors of society, adapting to climate change essentially requires the public to envision and adjust to alternative futures. There is a need for more studies on the social basis for climate change asking why people hold the attitudes they do, rather than the dominant tendency to ask how to change attitudes and behavior. Research in different fields show that fundamental life values and worldviews are shaped through life and heavily influenced by early life socialization and culture, which in turn can shape attitudes toward specific phenomena like climate change. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian public and examined how cultural resources and trust in environmental governance institutions are related to attitudes toward climate change. High levels of trust are associated with a tendency to perceive climate change as human caused, and low levels of trust correspond with stronger beliefs that climate change are natural phenomena. High levels of cultural resources are found among climate change deniers as well as believers, indicating that groups with different political, professional and intellectual orientations, as well as life histories, may not trust climate change science. We argue that improved knowledge about the social basis for climate change is an imperative part of futures-oriented expertise.",10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.005,Futures,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

164,"Coping with climate change and its impact on productivity, income, and poverty: Evidence from the Himalayan region of Pakistan",Bahadur Rahut and Ali,2017-01-01,"The current study explores the climate-risk mitigating strategies adopted by farmers and their impact on household income, poverty levels and wheat yield in the Himalayan region of Pakistan. This study is based on a primary dataset collected from 500 farmers through a field survey from the seven districts of the Himalayan region of northern Pakistan: Ghizer, Gilgit, Diamer, Astore, Skardu, Ghance, and Hunza-Nagar. A multivariate probit was employed to estimate the determinants of choice of adaptation strategies by farmers and a propensity score matching approach was used to estimate the impact of coping strategies on wellbeing. The most common climate-risk management strategies adopted at farm level include an adjustment in the sowing time, adoption of resistant varieties, tree plantation, non-farm participation as well as crop-livestock interaction. The impact of all these risk-management strategies was estimated individually as well as jointly. The empirical results indicated that farmers with higher levels of education and secured land rights mostly adopt more climate-risk mitigating strategies. The overall PSM results show that household income levels are high (in the range of PKR 1658-2610 per month), indicating that those households adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher income levels. The ATT results for the wheat yield are in the range of 42-65 kg per hectare, indicating that farmers adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher wheat yields. The ATT results for poverty are negative and significant, indicating that households adopting climate-risk management strategies have lower poverty levels (in the range of 2-4%). Increasing public awareness and supporting households in risk-mitigating strategies in the Himalayan region could be a crucial policy measure in reducing vulnerability to climate change, thereby increasing wellbeing.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.05.006,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
165,"Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk reduction integration: Strategies, Policies, and Plans in three Australian Local Governments",Forino et al.,2017-01-01,"Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) integration is a pressing concern for Australia. Normative instruments such as Strategies, Policies, and Plans are among the principal ways that Local Governments (LGs) use to promote CCA & DRR integration. To understand how CCA & DRR integration is promoted into Strategies, Policies, and Plans by Australian LGs, the paper performs a content analysis of documents in Singleton, Newcastle, and Lake Macquarie -three LGs located in the Hunter region, New South Wales (NSW). Findings indicate that: (i) the three selected LGs recognize that climate change exacerbates frequency and intensity for hazards; (ii) some documents include common goals for promoting CCA, showing synergies among different topics; (iii) documents recommend CCA measures for several aspects of the built environment, including land-use, building standards, and infrastructure and asset materials; and, (iv) public participation mechanisms were proposed to enact CCA measures. While these measures are important, understanding how CCA will be implemented is still necessary. Fragmentation exists between CCA goals in these LGs and future programs by the NSW government for the built environment in the Hunter region. Additionally, efforts are required to understand how public participation mechanisms can contribute to addressing vulnerabilities to climate changerelated hazards. Finally, the initial evidence shows that the Lake Macquarie LG shows greater commitment in CCA & DRR integration than Newcastle and Singleton LGs. The paper demonstrates that a focus on how LGs promote CCA & DRR integration into Strategies, Policies, and Plans can extend our understanding of climate change response by LGs.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.05.021,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
166,Institutional challenges to climate change adaptation: A case study on policy action gaps in Uganda,Ampaire et al.,2017-01-01,"Despite the considerable progress made in the last decade towards building governance systems for climate change adaptation in Africa, implementation still limits positive responses. This study applies an iterative process of field assessments and literature reviews across multiple governance levels and spatial scales to identify constraints to effective formulation and implementation of climate change related policies and strategies in Uganda. Data was collected through sex-segregated participatory vulnerability assessments with farming communities in Rakai district, policy document reviews, and interviews with policy actors at national and district levels. Findings reveal that the key challenges to effective policy implementation are diverse and cut across the policy development and implementation cycle. Policies are mainly developed by central government agencies; other actors are insufficiently involved while local communities are excluded. There is also a communication disconnect between national, district, and community levels. Coupled with limited technical capacity and finances, political interference, and absence of functional implementation structures across these levels, climate change adaptation becomes constrained. We propose strategies that enhance linkages between levels and actors, which will improve policy formulation, implementation and ultimately adaptation by smallholders.",10.1016/j.envsci.2017.05.013,Environmental Science & Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

However, there are a wide variety of responses to hazards at the municipal level. Why do communities take adaptive action in the face of weather- and climate-related risk? We studied what cities are doing in response to existing natural hazards, such as floods, droughts, and blizzards as an analog for understanding the drivers of adaptive behavior toward climate change risks. We conducted a survey of 60 U.S. municipalities followed by six in-depth case studies in the intermountain west states of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah that regularly experience weather and climate extreme events. Our analysis shows that perception of risk and external factors such as planning requirements and availability of funding stand out as important drivers. Nevertheless, political action is rarely driven by a single factor or event. Overall, our results suggest that multiple factors interact or act in combination to produce an enabling environment for action in the face of weather- and climate-related risk.",10.1177/0308518X16688686,Environment and Planning a-Economy and Space,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
168,Analysis of Coastal Environmental Management Practices in Subregions of California and Brazil,Obraczka et al.,2017-01-01,"Globally, human and natural systems in urban coasts face multiple threats, most importantly from climate change. Increasingly, subnational state and local governments are being forced to include climate change impacts into coastal planning and management. Urban coastal managers are looking to more transparent and integrated coastal and environmental management regimes to better address the multiple stressors and uses, as well as to integrate public and stakeholder participation, and maximize a broad range of community economic and environmental and ecosystem benefits. This research presents a case study of coastal and environment management systems in two important coastal regions: an urbanized area of the central coast of California, United States; and the rapidly urbanizing and developing coastal lowlands of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Similarities and differences in coastal environmental governance, management, and outcomes were identified and analyzed. The contrasting federalist governance structures are compared, and the coastal management and environment assessment systems in the case study locations are analyzed. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on subnational coastal environmental management systems through the review of previous relevant studies; the examination of historical primary and secondary source official reports; and the collection, analysis, and discussion of important qualitative and quantitative interviews and survey data. The study concludes that transparency and accessibility to the decision-making process are essential to the success of coastal environmental management in both locations, with benefits arising from the presence of public participation and trust. The successful integration of broad stakeholders and public awareness in California provides an example that could possibly be replicable in Rio de Janeiro to increase stakeholder participation in the decision-making processes. The paper concludes with recommendations for further studies of governance and management alternatives, and for extending and strengthening state and local capabilities of coastal environmental processes within integrated coastal environmental management systems.",10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00239.1,Journal of Coastal Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
169,Adaptation or conflict? Responses to climate change in water management in Bangladesh,Sultana and Thompson,2017-01-01,"The potential of climate change to impact local conflict and cooperation over natural resources has received relatively little attention. Bangladesh floodplains are highly vulnerable to environmental stresses that are worsening with climate change, and community organisations have to respond to water insecurity seasonally too little or too much. Two case studies based on action research in contrasting water and climate stressed floodplain environments in Bangladesh investigate local conflicts over water management that worsened when water regimes changed. By overcoming conflicts and improving adaptation for all local actors the cases reveal the importance of local knowledge, innovations in institutions, external facilitation, and incentives provided by disadvantaged groups who contribute towards costs in return for a share in decision making power and better adapted water management. The cases show how community organisations diversified their responsibilities and took up the challenge of water management to address local priorities and overcome conflicts. Without a more flexible and enabling approach, public investments in adaptation are likely to focus on strengthening existing water management infrastructure without understanding local social interactions and complexity. This may strengthen elite dominance and local conflicts if there is no comparable investment in developing robust and fair local institutions.",10.1016/j.envsci.2017.09.011,Environmental Science & Policy,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
170,Understanding and Managing the Effects of Climate Change on Ecosystem Services in the Rocky Mountains,Halofsky et al.,2017-01-01,"Public lands in the US Rocky Mountains provide critical ecosystem services, especially to rural communities that rely on these lands for fuel, food, water, and recreation. Climate change will likely affect the ability of these lands to provide ecosystem services. We describe 2 efforts to assess climate change vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains. We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species. Climate change will likely increase recreation participation. However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities. Federal agencies are now transitioning from the planning phase of climate change adaptation to implementation to ensure that ecosystem services will continue to be provided from federal lands in a changing climate.",10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00087.1,Mountain Research and Development,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
171,How Local Landholder Groups Collectively Manage Weeds in South-Eastern Australia,Graham and Rogers,2017-01-01,"For two decades researchers and policy makers have been arguing that community-based collective action is needed to effectively control weeds. Yet there has been little social research into the ways that collective weed control emerges at local scales. The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms through which three local landholder groups in south-eastern Australia collectively manage weeds and the measures they use to evaluate success. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of three Landcare groups-Jerrawa Creek/Upper Lachlan, MacLaughlin River and Towamba Valley-as well as government staff external to the groups. The results reveal that for all three groups collective weed control is about supporting individual weed control efforts as well as proactively engaging landholders with the worst infestations. The groups were seen to be successful because they focused on the common challenge that weeds pose to all landholders, thereby removing the shame associated with having weeds, and because they organised community events that were as much about building and maintaining social relationships as improving weed control. Groups were positive about what they had achieved as collectives of landholders, but also saw an important role for government in providing funding, engaging with landholders who were unwilling to engage directly with the group, and controlling weeds on public lands.",10.1007/s00267-017-0859-7,Environmental Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

However, although the role of learning in shaping public policy is well understood, and experiments are expected to facilitate learning, little is known about how experiments produce learning, what types of learning, and how they can be designed to enhance learning effects. Using quantitative research methods, we explore how design choices influence the learning experiences of 173 participants in 18 policy experiments conducted in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2016. The experiments are divided into three ""ideal types"" that are expected to produce different levels and types of learning. The findings show that policy experiments produce cognitive and relational learning effects, but less normative learning, and experiment design influenced three of six measured dimensions of learning, especially the cognitive learning dimensions. This reveals a trade-off between designing for knowledge development and designing for normative or relational changes; choices that experiment designers should make in the context of their adaptation problem. Our findings also show the role leadership plays in building trust.",10.3390/w9090648,Water,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

This paper examines the preparedness of different levels of government to adapt in the Canadian Arctic territory of Nunavut, drawing upon semi-structured interviews with government personnel and organizations involved in adaptation. In the Government of Nunavut, there have been notable developments around adaptation planning and examples of adaptation champions, but readiness for adaptation is challenged by a number of factors including the existence of pressing socio-economic problems, and institutional and governmental barriers. Federally, there is evidence of high-level leadership on adaptation, the creation of adaptation programs, and allocation of funds for adaptation, although the focus has been mostly on researching adaptation options as opposed to supporting actual actions or policy change. The 2016 Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, and increasing emphasis on climate change federally and in the Government of Nunavut, offer opportunities for advancing adaptation, but concrete steps are needed to ensure readiness is enhanced.",10.1007/s10584-017-2071-4,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The analysis was based on a survey conducted in the City of Panama Beach in Florida (USA). Survey items relate to people's risk perception, hazard experience, threat appraisal, and coping appraisal, whose theoretical background is Protection Motivation Theory. Descriptive and correlation analysis was first performed to highlight critical factors which were then examined by a multinomial Logit model. Results show that sea level rise awareness is the major explanatory variable. Coping appraisal is qualitatively viewed as a strong predictor for action, while threat appraisal is statistically significant in driving relocation intention. These factors should be integrated in current risk communication regarding sea level rise.",10.3390/w9120941,Water,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
175,"Addressing vulnerability, building resilience: community-based adaptation to vector-borne diseases in the context of global change",Bardosh et al.,2017-01-01,"Background: The threat of a rapidly changing planet - of coupled social, environmental and climatic change - pose new conceptual and practical challenges in responding to vector-borne diseases. These include non-linear and uncertain spatial-temporal change dynamics associated with climate, animals, land, water, food, settlement, conflict, ecology and human socio-cultural, economic and political-institutional systems. To date, research efforts have been dominated by disease modeling, which has provided limited practical advice to policymakers and practitioners in developing policies and programmes on the ground. Main body: In this paper, we provide an alternative biosocial perspective grounded in social science insights, drawing upon concepts of vulnerability, resilience, participation and community-based adaptation. Our analysis was informed by a realist review (provided in the Additional file 2) focused on seven major climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases: malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue, leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, chagas disease, and rift valley fever. Here, we situate our analysis of existing community-based interventions within the context of global change processes and the wider social science literature. We identify and discuss best practices and conceptual principles that should guide future community-based efforts to mitigate human vulnerability to vector-borne diseases. We argue that more focused attention and investments are needed in meaningful public participation, appropriate technologies, the strengthening of health systems, sustainable development, wider institutional changes and attention to the social determinants of health, including the drivers of co-infection. Conclusion: In order to respond effectively to uncertain future scenarios for vector-borne disease in a changing world, more attention needs to be given to building resilient and equitable systems in the present.",10.1186/s40249-017-0375-2,Infectious Diseases of Poverty,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
176,Is the participatory formulation of policy strategies worth the effort? The case of climate change adaptation in Austria,Prutsch et al.,2018-01-01,"Participation is usually regarded as a good practice in environmental policymaking, but its effects on policy strategies are unclear. Based on literature research, surveys, and interviews with participants, the present paper assesses whether decisional participation in formulating Austria's National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) was worth the effort. Assessed against the goals of the participation process, we find that it raised awareness for adaptation and facilitated an exchange among the participants and that it improved the content of the NAS. However, regarding the goal of enhancing the acceptance of and commitment to the NAS, we find that this has been achieved among those who participated but not among high-level policymakers who are responsible for implementing the NAS. We conclude that (decisional) participation has its benefits in formulating comprehensive policy strategies but that it is most likely not able to overhaul their well-documented weaknesses, among them weak political commitment and implementation failures.",10.1007/s10113-017-1204-7,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
177,Principles for climate-related resettlement of informal settlements in less developed nations: a review of resettlement literature and institutional guidelines,Tadgell et al.,2018-01-01,"The severity of climatic changes threatening urban coastal areas is introducing and intensifying environmental hazards that are endangering physical safety and livelihood security. This paper considers retreat, one of three broad adaptation options proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as a possible climate change adaptation strategy for low-income communities in less developed nations. Resettlement as climate change adaptation is a developing concept, with minimal guidelines and academic literature on the topic. Thus, this review expands beyond climate change, considering three literature themes surrounding resettlement: (1) climate change, (2) hazard and natural disasters (i.e. floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes), and (3) economic development (i.e. dam construction and natural resource extraction). The review extracts successful resettlement planning and approaches, as well as the lessons learned, to identify five principles for resettlement in a climate change context: Proactivity, Communication and Participation, Permanence, Compensation, and Livelihood Protection. The results of the analysis suggest five principles that can be used as a guideline for implementing resettlement as climate change adaptation for low-income and informal communities in less developed nations. Ultimately, these recommendations can be used to assess the appropriateness and feasibility of employing resettlement as managed retreat in less developed nations.",10.1080/17565529.2017.1291401,Climate and Development,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
178,Framework for a collaborative process to increase preparation for drought on US public rangelands,Brugger et al.,2018-01-01,"We describe a theoretically based framework (C-PMT+HAPA) for designing and evaluating collaborative processes to increase preparation for natural hazards in situations in which preparedness decisions are shared and actions must be taken jointly by more than one party. The framework combines two health behavior change theories from psychology, protection motivation theory (PMT) and the health action process approach (HAPA), with collaboration theory in natural resources management. The framework provides much needed guidance for designing the activities in which participants will collaborate and suggests theoretically supported intermediate outcomes that may indicate a successful trajectory toward the ultimate goal of increased preparation. We used this framework in a collaborative process, with participation by ranchers with grazing permits and U.S. Forest Service managers on the Tonto National Forest, to increase preparation for drought on public rangelands in the Southwestern U.S. Evaluation of intermediate outcomes indicated: (1) improved interactions and relations between parties; (2) improved ability to appraise drought risks; (3) improved understanding of the U.S. Forest Service process for approving practices that increase preparation for drought; and; (4) increased motivation to implement these practices. The strength of the intermediate outcomes suggests that the C-PMT+HAPA framework would be an effective, theoretically supported framework for designing and evaluating collaborative processes to encourage preparation for natural hazards. More generally, the framework could contribute to more transdisciplinary, system-and action-oriented research on disaster risk reduction that is coproduced with multiple stakeholders.",10.5751/ES-10503-230418,Ecology and Society,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
179,Bridging the legitimacy gap-translating theory into practical signposts for legitimate flood risk governance,Alexander et al.,2018-01-01,"Legitimacy is widely regarded as a founding principle of 'good' and effective governance, yet despite intense academic debate and policy discourse, the concept remains conceptually confusing and poorly articulated in practice. To bridge this gap, this research performed an interpretive thematic analysis of academic scholarship across public administration, public policy, law, political science, and geography. Four core themes were identified in relation to representative deliberation, procedural and distributive equity and justice, and socio-political acceptability, with numerous sub-themes therein. In an attempt to clarify conceptual confusion, this paper grounds these theoretical debates in the context of flood risk governance where numerous legitimacy dilemmas exist. A number of questions are presented as conceptual 'signposts' to encourage reflexive governance in the future. Thus, more broadly, we assert the importance of bringing legitimacy to the forefront of contemporary flood risk governance discourse and practice, moving beyond the realm of academic reflection.",10.1007/s10113-017-1195-4,Regional Environmental Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The diversity of environmental determinants requires the formulation of individual plans dedicated to the most significant local issues. This article serves as a methodic proposition for the stage of retrieving data (with the PESTEL and the Delphi method), systemic diagnosis (evaluation of risk and susceptibility), prognosis (goal trees, goal intensity map) and the formulation of urban adaptation plans. The suggested solution complies with the Polish guidelines for establishing adaptation plans. The proposed methodological approach guarantees the participation of various groups of stakeholders in the process of working on urban adaptation plans, which is in accordance with the current tendencies to strengthen the role of public participation in spatial management.",10.12911/22998993/81658,Journal of Ecological Engineering,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
181,"How a coastal community looks at coastal hazards and risks in a vulnerable barrier island system (Faro Beach, southern Portugal)",Domingues et al.,2018-01-01,"Faro Beach is a vulnerable and heavily urbanized settlement in the Ria Formosa barrier island system, exposed to beach erosion, overwash and other hazards that have resulted in house and road destruction. Residents have accepted the risks in exchange for the benefits of living at the beach. Previous qualitative studies have suggested that residents' risk perception is low and incongruent with the real risk to which they are exposed to. In this study we aimed to evaluate residents' awareness and risk perception, as well as determinants and outcomes of risk perception, using a quantitative approach based on the psychometric paradigm. Results show that Faro Beach residents possess significant knowledge on coastal hazards and awareness of risks that derive mainly from life experience. Other sources of information (environmental education campaigns, public discussions and formal education) are mostly irrelevant for residents. Their risk perception is relatively high, but they believe hazards are not that dangerous and are distant in time; consequently, their preparedness towards risks is low. Residents' risk perception is related to their length of residence at the beach (mostly > 10 years), their ""positive"" past experience with hazards, that never resulted in fatalities, and their psychological distance in relation to threats, all of which may hamper residents' preparedness in case of disaster. Other behavioural barriers, such as mistrust in authorities, externalisation of responsibility, optimism bias, or low self efficacy, may also hinder their preparation efforts. Authorities' efforts to give more information and education to coastal populations in order to increase risk perceptions or decrease psychological distance may have the opposite effect, given that individuals use a variety of strategies to psychologically cope with threats and thus maintain their psychological well-being. A thorough knowledge of the psychological determinants and responses to coastal risks is thus highly relevant in the context of coastal management.",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.03.015,Ocean & Coastal Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

It also examines the change of directions, forms and tools of the Transcarpathian interrelations with neighboring regions during the second half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. It is determined that the main areas of cross-bonier cooperation with the participation of Transcarpathia are such: forestry activities, tourism, transboundary ecological-economic cooperation, development of local culture and preservation of historical heritage; environment protection, mitigation and adaptation to climate change; improving the access to the regions, developing sustainable and climate friendly transport and communications networks and systems; common challenges in the field of security and protection, growth of population welfare of the border areas, activation of foreign economic relations, etc. The main organizational forms of cross-bonier cooperation include: clusters, urban agglomerations, regional networks, transport corridors, interregional industrial alliances, interregional business associations, interregional corporation, regional agreements and projects, Euroregions, etc. The article points out that the most promising direction of activation of foreign economic relations in the studied territory is the expansion of the network of cross-bonier tourist clusters in the Ukrainian-Slovak, Ukrainian-Hungarian, Ukrainian-Romanian and Ukrainian-Polish transboundary regions. One of such projects may be a tourist cluster covering the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine and the bothering areas. The main problems of further development of cross-border cooperation with the participation of Transcarpathia are identified, namely: insufficient institutional and legal support of the system of cross-bonier cooperation of Ukrainian regions; excessive centralization of foreign economic activity, restrictions that do not allow local self-government bodies to carry out the necessary volume of international economic relations; poor quality of service of the border traffic due to inconsistency of the design capacity of the international automobile check points with actual indicators and their congestion; insufficient investment climate of the bonier regions of Ukraine; ineffective use of grants; somewhat limited and poorly developed trunk-burden infrastructure, which is a major complication in trade with Ukraine, etc. Along with the economic and legal barriers of cross-bother cooperation, public barriers are important, particularly, negative historical experience, lack of entrepreneurial psychological readiness for business cooperation, mental differences, language barriers, lack of regional cross-border conscience, fear of losing identity, population expectations with regard to the practical results of cross-border cooperation is often not justified. Elimination of these barriers is a priority task, both at the state level and at the local level.",10.24919/2519-058x.6.123753,Skhidnoievropeiskyi Istorychnyi Visnyk-East European Historical Bulletin,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Using a unique dataset of 343 married women, logistic regression analysis is used to examine adaptation practices ranging from agricultural to coping and livelihood diversification strategies. Specifically, we investigate the role of wives' intrahousehold decision-making participation in adaptation decisions. Drawing on the literatures of intrahousehold bargaining and agricultural technology adoption, we argue that although extrahousehold factors are important determinants of households' adaptation behaviour, adaptation outcomes can also be different when decided by husbands or by wives. We find that when wives are more involved in intrahousehold adaptation decision-making, they are also more likely to choose to be engaged in non-farm income-earning activities, and their households are more likely to plant cover crops and drought-resistant crops. We argue that in general Tanzanian smallholders' adaptation options are limited and their intrahousehold bargaining sets relatively narrow, leaving little room for differing intrahousehold adaptation preferences, especially in the case of quasi-public household goods.",10.1080/17565529.2017.1318745,Climate and Development,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The assessment reviews local planning documents, includes a media analysis, a tourist survey, stakeholder interviews and we provide criteria for measuring success, derived from the Systems Approach Framework (SAF) concept. The full process in the Geltinger Birk took over 25 years and was finished in 2013. The early years were characterised by strong local opposition, a polarization of the local society, misinformation and negative media coverage. Land purchase, the establishment of a local information centre with an environmental manager, improved public participation, a more pro-active media strategy and the readiness to accept compromises finally enabled a successful implementation. Today, a comprehensive tourism information and guidance system exists and the area became a popular tourist place. 80% of all visitors point out the outstanding nature experience and 87% are positive about the combined coastal protection and restoration measure. Parallel, major stakeholders changed their attitude and today are positive about the situation. However, the long timespan between initiation of the process and implementation of the measure, calls for a systematic, guided management approach, like the SAF. Especially, because climate change, sea level rise and increasing pressures on the coasts require a much faster implementation of adaptation measures in future.",10.1007/s11852-017-0496-6,Journal of Coastal Conservation,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

187,A climate for commerce: the political agronomy of conservation agriculture in Zambia,Westengen et al.,2018-01-01,"The promotion of conservation agriculture (CA) for smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa is subject to ongoing scholarly and public debate regarding the evidence-base and the agenda-setting power of involved stakeholders. We undertake a political analysis of CA in Zambia that combines a qualitative case study of a flagship CA initiative with a quantitative analysis of a nationally representative dataset on agricultural practices. This analysis moves from an investigation of the knowledge politics to a study of how the political agendas of the actors involved are shaping agrarian practices. From its initial focus on CA as soil conservation and sustainable agriculture, the framing of the initiative has evolved to accommodate shifting trends in the policy arena. In tandem with the increased focus on climate adaptation, we see an increased emphasis on private sector-led modernisation. The initiative has shifted its target group from the poorest smallholders to prospective commercial farmers, and has forged connections between its farmer-to-farmer extension network and private input suppliers and service providers. The link between CA and input intensification is reflected in national statistics as a significantly higher usage of herbicides, pesticides and mineral fertilizer on fields under CA tillage compared to other fields. We argue that the environmental and participation agendas are used to buttress CA as an environmentally and socially sustainable agricultural development strategy, while the prevailing practice is the result of a common vision for a private sector-led agricultural development shared between the implementing organisation, the donor and international organisations promoting a new green revolution in Africa.",10.1007/s10460-017-9820-x,Agriculture and Human Values,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
188,Application of the City Blueprint Approach to assess the challenges of water management and governance in Quito (Ecuador),Schreurs et al.,2018-01-01,"In this paper, we provide an assessment of the challenges of water, waste and climate change in the city of Quito by performing the City Blueprint Approach consisting of three assessment frameworks: (1) the Trends and Pressure Framework (TPF), (2) the City Blueprint Framework (CBF) and (3) the water Governance Capacity Framework (GCF). The TPF summarizes the main social, environmental and financial aspects that may affect urban water management. The CBF provides a clear overview of sustainable urban water management performance and its bottlenecks in municipalities and regions. The GCF comprises nine governance conditions which each consist of three indicators. The GCF provides insight in the most effective improvements to increase the governance capacity to address the identified urban water challenges. Our results show that poor wastewater treatment and long-term drinking water security are Quito's main water challenges that may be jeopardized given the city's rapid urbanization and economic pressure. The GCF analysis reveals that cooperation between stakeholders, implementing capacity and citizens' awareness are the most important conditions for further development to find adequate solutions for Quito's long-term drinking water security. We also suggest that more attention should be drawn to the transparency, accountability and participation principles. The results of Quito show that the City Blueprint Approach can serve as an affordable quick-scan to facilitate cities in their strategic planning to reach their sustainable development goals.",10.1007/s10668-017-9916-x,Environment Development and Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

However, existing environmental behavioral studies have not sufficiently addressed the relationship among perceptions of climate change, living conditions, social demographic factors and environmentally friendly behavior. Therefore, this paper investigates whether environmental perception and other social determinants such as living conditions and the subjective evaluation of social inequality affect environmentally friendly behavior. We use survey data (N = 1500) collected in Mumbai, India, and analyze our hypotheses using a structural equation model (SEM). The empirical results confirm the direct and indirect influences of environmentally related perceptions, the subjective evaluation of living environments, social factors and other demographic characteristics on pro-environmental behavior. In particular, we find a robust positive effect of education level on pro-environmental behavior, where we observe both a direct impact and an indirect impact through positive effects on environmental knowledge. Thus, we confirm the importance of living environment, social equality and education in sustainable urban planning and efforts to mitigate climate change.",10.3390/su10040937,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Knowing public imaginaries of adaptation governance is important for the legitimacy and efficacy of adaptation processes. In this paper, we explain how the public imagines the governance of adaptation across scales, based on 80 in-depth interviews with coastal residents in south-eastern Australia. We find an overwhelming preference for government leadership on adaptation, little appetite for exclusively non-government responsibility regimes, and limited desire for shared public/private responsibility regimes. Participant responses indicate a broad preference for a multilevel government governance model, with responsibility weighted at local and national scales. This preference for a strong but distributed government function is at odds with the emerging tendency of governments to shift the weight of responsibility for adaptation down to local governments and to private actors.",10.1177/2399654417719557,Environment and Planning C-Politics and Space,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
191,Linking livestock snow disastermortality and environmental stressors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: Quantification based on generalized additive models,Li et al.,2018-01-01,"Livestock snowdisaster occurswidely in Central-to-Eastern Asian temperate and alpine grasslands. The effects of snowdisaster on livestock involve a complex interaction between precipitation, vegetation, livestock, and herder communities. Quantifying the relationship among livestock mortality, snow hazard intensity, and seasonal environmental stressors is of great importance for snow disaster early warning, risk assessments, and adaptation strategies. Using a wide-spatial extent, long-time series, and event-based livestock snow disaster dataset, this study quantified those relationships and established a quantitative model of livestock mortality for prediction purpose for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Estimations using generalized additive models (GAMs) were shown to accurately predict livestock mortality and mortality rate due to snow disaster, with adjusted-R-2 up to 0.794 and 0.666, respectively. These results showed that a longer snow disaster duration, lower temperatures during the disaster, and a drier summer with less vegetation all contribute significantly and non-linearly to higher mortality ( rate), after controlling for elevation and socioeconomic conditions. These results can be readily applied to risk assessment and risk-based adaptation actions. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

192,"Transformations for Resilient Rural Futures: The Case of Kaikura, Aotearoa-New Zealand",Cradock-Henry et al.,2018-01-01,"On 14 November 2016, a magnitude (M-w) 7.8 earthquake struck the small coastal settlement of Kaikura, Aotearoa-New Zealand. With an economy based on tourism, agriculture, and fishing, Kaikura was immediately faced with significant logistical, economic, and social challenges caused by damage to critical infrastructure and lifelines, essential to its main industries. Massive landslips cut off road and rail access, stranding hundreds of tourists, and halting the collection, processing and distribution of agricultural products. At the coast, the seabed rose two metres, limiting harbour-access to high tide, with implications for whale watching tours and commercial fisheries. Throughout the region there was significant damage to homes, businesses, and farmland, leaving owners and residents facing an uncertain future. This paper uses qualitative case study analysis to explore post-quake transformations in a rural context. The aim is to gain insight into the distinctive dynamics of disaster response mechanisms, focusing on two initiatives that have emerged in direct response to the disaster. The first examines the ways in which agriculture, food harvesting, production and distribution are being reimagined with the potential to enhance regional food security. The second examines the rescaling of power in decision-making processes following the disaster, specifically examining the ways in which rural actors are leveraging networks to meet their needs and the consequences of that repositioning on rural (and national) governance arrangements. In these and other ways, the local economy is being revitalised, and regional resilience enhanced through diversification, capitalising not on the disaster but the region's natural, social, and cultural capital. Drawing on insights and experience of local stakeholders, policy- and decision-makers, and community representatives we highlight the diverse ways in which these endeavours are an attempt to create something new, revealing also the barriers which needed to be overcome to reshape local livelihoods. Results reveal that the process of transformation as part of rural recovery must be grounded in the lived reality of local residents and their understanding of place, incorporating and building on regional social, environmental, and economic characteristics. In this, the need to respond rapidly to realise opportunities must be balanced with the community-centric approach, with greater recognition given to the contested nature of the decisions to be made. Insights from the case examples can inform preparedness and recovery planning elsewhere, and provide a rich, real-time example of the ways in which disasters can create opportunities for reimagining resilient futures.",10.3390/su10061952,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
193,The interplay between planned and autonomous adaptation in response to climate change: Insights from rural Ethiopia,Mersha and van Laerhoven,2018-01-01,"Using the notion of institutional interplay, which refers to situations where the operation or consequences of one regime influence another regime, the article explores the interplay between planned adaptation and farmer households' autonomous adaptation. Drawing empirical data from two drought-prone districts in Northeastern Ethiopia (Kobo and Raya Azebo), this article deals with the differentiated effects of planned adaptation, exemplified by Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Two layers of differentiating effects are studied by looking at the differences between households that are and households that are not targeted by PSNP; and the more detailed differences are explored by zooming in on male and female-headed households, respectively, within the subset of households targeted by PSNP. We use semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with female and male household heads and key informant interviews with government officials. Our study indicates that the interplay has a differentiated effect following the participation of households in planned adaptation programs and gender lines. We show that the effect on building community assets can be positive at the community level and expands autonomous adaptation particularly for non-targeted households; however, targeted households in general and female-headed households in particular experience a negative effect of the interplay: planned adaptation constrains autonomous adaptation due to time and labor demands of public work, program restrictions and local gender norms.

195,Water torture: Unravelling the psychological distress of irrigators in Australia,Wheeler et al.,2018-01-01,"Water institutional and property right reform in the food bowl of Australia, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), has generated both benefits and costs for irrigators. Water allocation uncertainty along with the increased risk of recurring drought has been gradually placed back on irrigators to manage, and in the last decade there has been considerable reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use in the MDB, which has caused much angst within rural communities. In the face of such change this study provides, for the first time, a large-scale profile (n = 1000) of irrigators' mental health in the MDB. Our point estimates suggest some irrigation industries in 2015-16 recorded some of the highest levels of psychological distress nationally; higher than dryland farmers or the Australian population. Financial difficulties were most associated with this distress, but it was intertwined and underpinned by the ongoing threat of water scarcity, which irrigators often incorrectly associate with the implementation of the Basin Plan. Psychological distress varied by industry and location: horticulturists reported the highest levels of distress, followed by broadacre, dairy and livestock. Future national water policy must consider the real impacts of water recovery, and recognize that so-called 'socially neutral' water recovery policies can actually cause significant community harm where they hamper farm exit and adaptation to a hotter future. We recommend that future water policy must focus on i) encouraging fanner adaptation (hence supporting water entitlement buy-back and eliminating on-farm irrigation infrastructure subsidies); and ii) removing farm exit barriers.",10.1016/j.jrurstud.2018.08.006,Journal of Rural Studies,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
196,"The Influence of Poverty Alleviation Resettlement on Rural Household Livelihood Vulnerability in the Western Mountainous Areas, China",Liu et al.,2018-01-01,"Poverty alleviation resettlement (PAR) is China's largest-ever resettlement program and one of China's flagship poverty alleviation initiatives. Resorting to this state-led conversation and development program, the central and provincial governments aim to lift the poor out of the poverty trap and into sustainable livelihoods, by delivering improvements in housing conditions, infrastructure services, public amenities, and living standards. Taking Ankang as an example, this study examines the PAR from the perspective of vulnerability through a household survey conducted in Ankang prefecture of Shaanxi province, China. A total of six townships in Ankang are covered, with 657 valid questionnaires collected. This study shows that there is a difference in exposure, sensitivity, and the adaptive capacity of rural households with different relocation characteristics, hence generating different livelihood vulnerabilities. The PAR generally achieves the target of livelihood vulnerability reduction. Specifically, the project-induced relocation has a significant positive effect on vulnerability, but there is a significant negative correlation between livelihood vulnerability and relocation region, relocation time, and relocation subsidy. Challenges and problems remain to be addressed for the next phases of the PAR, including diminishing the financial burden on those relocated and providing free public transportation services, carrying out community-building programs and updating the household registration institution, balancing the redistribution and sharing of farmland, furnishing assistance measures for employment searches and training in specific skills, and creating an impartial project to safeguard the non-movers from the significant negative impacts on their physical and spiritual dimensions.",10.3390/su10082793,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
197,Is Jakarta's New Flood Risk Reduction Strategy Transformational?,Garschagen et al.,2018-01-01,"On a conceptual and normative level, the debate around transformation in the context of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation has been rising sharply over the recent years. Yet, whether and how transformation occurs in the messy realities of policy and action, and what separates it from other forms of risk reduction, is far from clear. Jakarta appears to be the perfect example to study these questions. It is amongst the cities with the highest flood risk in the world. Its flood hazard is driven by land subsidence, soil sealing, changes in river discharge, andincreasinglysea level rise. As all of these trends are set to continue, Jakarta's flood hazard is expected to intensify in the future. Designing and implementing large-scale risk reduction and adaption measures therefore has been a priority of risk practitioners and policy-makers at city and national level. Against this background, the paper draws on a document analysis and original empirical household survey data to review and evaluate current adaptation measures and to analyze in how far they describe a path that is transformational from previous risk reduction approaches. The results show that the focus is clearly on engineering solutions, foremost in the Giant Sea Wall project. The project is likely to transform the city's flood hydrology. However, it cements rather than transforms the current risk management paradigm which gravitates around the goal of controlling flood symptoms, rather than addressing their largely anthropogenic root causes. The results also show that the planned measures are heavily contested due to concerns about ecological impacts, social costs, distributional justice, public participation, and long-term effectiveness. On the outlook, the results therefore suggest that the more the flood hazard intensifies in the future, the deeper a societal debate will be needed about the desired pathway in flood risk reduction and overall development planningparticularly with regards to the accepted levels of transformation, such as partial retreat from the most flood-affected areas.",10.3390/su10082934,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
198,Production of cereals in northern marginal areas: An integrated assessment of climate change impacts at the farm level,Purola et al.,2018-01-01,"Crop production in northern regions is projected to benefit from longer growing seasons brought on by future climate change. However, production also faces multiple challenges due to more frequent and intense extreme weather phenomena, and uncertain future prices of agricultural inputs and outputs. Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of climate change on cereals yield change, but integrated assessments that also consider the management and economy of cereal farms have been rare so far. In this study, the effects of climate change-driven crop productivity change on farm level land use dynamics, input use, production management and farm income were considered from the point of view of dynamic decision making of a rational risk averse farmer. We assessed whether a farmer can gain from improved crop yields when using adapted cultivars and managing the farm accordingly. We incorporated crop yield estimates from a process-based large area crop model (MCWLA) run with two climate scenarios into a dynamic economic model of farm management and crop rotation (DEMCROP) to investigate future input use, land use with crop rotation, economic gross margins and greenhouse gas emissions. A time span of 30 years was considered. The model accounts for the yield responses to fertilisation, crop protection, liming of field parcels, and yield losses due to monoculture. The approach resulted in a novel and necessary analysis of farm management, production and income implications of climate change adaptation under different climate and socio-economic scenarios. We analysed the effects of different climate and price scenarios at a typical cereal farm in the North Savo region, which is currently a marginal area for crop production in Finland due to its harsh climate. Crop modelling results suggest a 19-27% increase of spring cereal yields and 11-19% increase of winter wheat yields from the current level until 2042-2070. According to our economic farm level simulations, these yield increases would incentivise farmers towards more intense input use resulting in additional increase of yields by 3-8% at current prices. More land is allocated to barley and wheat, less to set-aside and oat. The economic gross margin would increase significantly from the current low levels. Greenhouse gas emissions from farms were estimated to increase with increasing production, but emissions per quantity produced (measured as feed energy units) would decrease. There is potential for sustainable intensification (SI) of crop production in the region.",10.1016/j.agsy.2018.01.018,Agricultural Systems,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Many adaptation strategies implemented in coastal areas remain inadequate or ineffective. Using primarily events and interventions carried out along the Portuguese Atlantic coast, this work aims to show the paradigm shift that has occurred in Portugal since the last century (the 1990s) within the scope of the National Coastal Zone Management Strategy, taking into account the new guidelines for the implementation of coastal defence works. In this context, this paper also aims to assist coastal communities in carrying out operational coastal management by presenting and discussing management tools and primary options that should be considered in any adaptation programme that is to be implemented. Both nonstructural and structural measures are considered. Action plans, warning systems, emergency plans, and evacuation plans belong to the first category. Education and training are also considered, because they play a key role in the sustainability of coastal areas, especially in the coming generations. Structural measures are adaptation options that are designed to increase the safety of people and reduce risks. They are discussed and grouped into categories that include accommodation, protection, and retreat. Recent cases of successful accommodation and protection measures implemented along the Portuguese coast are also presented and discussed.",10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00165.1,Journal of Coastal Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Our review of relevant literature revealed substantial environmental (cooler and cleaner environment), economic (reduced energy demand, avoided cost of drainage maintenance, increased land values) and social (higher social interaction, improved mental and physical health) benefits arising from the maintenance and development of ecosystem services in major cities. Our evaluation of green adaptation strategies was undertaken with household surveys in three wards of Dhaka, expert interviews, and our personal experiences. Rooftop gardens/agriculture had very high social acceptance (85%) and economic feasibility and was commonly practiced in Dhaka, particularly among house owners. Pocket park, green roof, rainwater harvest, green facades/wall, porous pavement, and community garden were all considered to be highly feasible for implementation with collective efforts but had lower social acceptance. Many respondents were unwilling to pay for green adaptation strategies even knowing their benefits. Our research revealed that successful implementation of beneficial green adaptation will require public participation at all stages supported through awareness raising campaigns. Enforcement of laws and strong commitment from the government was also considered to be beneficial. However, more transparent cost-benefit analyses promoting the conservation of ecosystem services is required, particularly for resource-poor Dhaka. Green adaptations make cities more resilient to pressures from demographic change and climate change increasingly relevant in the developing world.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.01.008,Landscape and Urban Planning,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
201,"Urban climate adaptation and the reshaping of state-society relations: The politics of community knowledge and mobilisation in Indore, India",Chu,2018-01-01,"Current research on climate change adaptation in cities highlights the role of local governments in facilitating adaptation actions, but rarely assesses whether (and if so, how) local communities organise around emerging climate priorities to affect political change. This paper explores changing state-society relationships through the reconstitution of community collectives and advocacy organisations for advancing climate change adaptation in the Indian city of Indore. The paper shows that communities are indeed recognising the need for adaptation but are, at the same time, integrating adaptation actions with existing strategies for advocating development rights. Communities are also rebuilding alliances between municipal and local institutions for public service and infrastructure provision, which point to the centrality of community politics in urban climate adaptation processes. However, such mobilisations are often dependent on existing political networks and a legacy of advocacy around poverty alleviation needs, which sideline more transformative agendas around inclusiveness, equity, and resilient urban futures.",10.1177/0042098016686509,Urban Studies,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
202,"A combined coastal protection, realignment and wetland restoration scheme in the southern Baltic: planning process, public information and participation",Schernewski et al.,2018-01-01,"Markgrafenheide-Hutelmoor covers a total area of 1000 ha (about 490 ha are coastal moor) and a coastline of about 6 km. This touristy area belongs to the city of Rostock in Germany. As response to sea level rise and heavy coastal erosion, the small seaside resort Markgrafenheide received a comprehensive storm surge protection until 2006. Subsequently, the adjacent Hutelmoor was flooded with the aim to restore it as a brackish coastal moor. Coastal protection measures at the Baltic Sea coastline were abandoned to enable natural dynamics, a coastal realignment and salt water intrusions. The entire process until full implementation took 14 years and was associated with very problematic public participation and a strong local polarization. Based on a literature and media review, two surveys, and expert interviews we retrospectively document and analyse the planning process with focus on public information, perception and participation. The local population and holidaymakers did not perceive coastal changes and if, did not associate them with climate change. Interviewees remembered single storm surges, but felt save from it and sea level rise was not perceived as a threat. 89% said that they feel insufficiently informed about the combined coastal protection wetland restoration measure, but did not use the offered information possibilities. 81% had their information from newspapers and freely distributed advertisers. It seems that insufficient information was the major reason for the problems with local acceptance and public participation. The media played a dominating role. The decline of traditional newspapers and the growths of free advertisers seemed to have a negative impact on quality of information and favoured a polarization. Additionally, we discuss local specifics like the cultural background (GDR history), traditions, frustration and the relatively old population and their role in public participation. We strongly promote a pro-active and long-term information and public relation strategy.",10.1007/s11852-017-0542-4,Journal of Coastal Conservation,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

204,"Integrated Technological and Management Solutions for Wastewater Treatment and Efficient Agricultural Reuse in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia",Frascari et al.,2018-01-01,"Mediterranean-African countries (MACs) face a major water crisis. The annual renewable water resources are close to the 500 m(3)/capita threshold of absolute water scarcity, and water withdrawals exceed total renewable water resources by 30%. Such a low water availability curbs economic development in agriculture, which accounts for 86% of freshwater consumption. The analysis of the current situation of wastewater treatment, irrigation, and water management in MACs and of the research projects targeted to these countries indicates the need for 1) an enhanced capacity to analyze water stress, 2) the development of water management strategies capable of including wastewater reuse, and 3) development of locally adapted water treatment and irrigation technologies. This analysis shaped the MADFORWATER project (www.madforwater.eu), whose goal is to develop a set of integrated technological and management solutions to enhance wastewater treatment, wastewater reuse for irrigation, and water efficiency in agriculture in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. MADFORWATER develops and adapts technologies for the production of irrigation-quality water from drainage canals and municipal, agro-industrial, and industrial wastewaters and technologies for water efficiency and reuse in agriculture, initially validated at laboratory scale, to 3 hydrological basins in the selected MACs. Selected technologies will be further adapted and validated in 4 demonstration plants of integrated wastewater treatment and reuse. Integrated strategies for wastewater treatment and reuse targeted to the selected basins are developed, and guidelines for the development of integrated water management strategies in other basins of the 3 target MACs will be produced. The social and technical suitability of the developed technologies and nontechnological tools in relation to the local context is evaluated with the participation of MAC stakeholders and partners. Guidelines on economic instruments and policies for the effective implementation of the proposed water management solutions in the target MACs will be developed. (C) 2018 The Authors.

205,Managing urban water systems with significant adaptation deficits-unified framework for secondary cities: part II-the practice,Pathirana et al.,2018-01-01,"Adaptation gaps are shortcomings of a system responding to climate change, whereas adaptation deficits are shortcomings in providing services. These two drivers for adaptation are often in conflict in many secondary cities in the global south (SCGS). It is possible to align these seemingly conflicting drivers into a productive unity, a conceptual alignment, which is the first step in achieving harmony while implementing adaptation actions. This paper focuses on the practical aspects of implementing aligned adaptation action that leads to improvements in liveability, sustainability, and resilience of SCGS. At an abstract level, the nature of the adaptation problem is similar to the complex problems identified in various domains, such as software development, manufacturing, and supply chain management. The widely accepted ""agile principles""-used in the above domains-is the basis for developing a set of twelve principles for urban adaptation, which are synthesized from numerous recent studies that have implicitly proposed or applied most of these principles to climate change adaptation in urban settings. These principles lead to four essential objectives appertaining to the process of sustainable urban adaptation. The urban agile principles are used to analyze the current state of adaptation of Can Tho City in Vietnam and to ascertain the agile ways of addressing its adaptation challenges. Analysis of the outcomes shows that harmonized approaches can simultaneously address both adaptation deficits and gaps.",10.1007/s10584-017-2059-0,Climatic Change,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
206,Informal Settlements and Flooding: Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses in Local Governance for Water Management,Williams et al.,2018-01-01,"Urbanization and climate change are compounding the vulnerability of flooding for the urban poor, particularly in the Global South. However, local governance can be a greater determinant of flood risk than the hazard itself. Identifying strengths and weaknesses in local governance for water management is therefore crucial. This paper presents a governance assessment for Quarry Road West informal settlement, Durban, South Africa, in relation to flood risk by applying the Capital Approach Framework. Through developing a deeper understanding of the current governance system, the embeddedness of several social values can also be gauged. This is important particularly for integrative and transdisciplinary management of flood risk, enacted in the case of Quarry Road West informal settlement through the Palmiet Rehabilitation Project, a multi sector partnership at the climate change and water governance interface. Findings from this study indicate that, currently, climate change adaptation remains a challenge for decision-makers and policy-planners. A more effective integration of the residents of Quarry Road West informal settlement into local governance for water management is urgently needed. This is particularly important in the context of informal settlements that are marginalized and often lacking governance mechanisms to affect change.",10.3390/w10070871,Water,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

But perhaps most significant is lack of public discussion about climate change.

Though general barriers and factors for change have been identified, fewer studies have assessed how different conditions influence municipalities' strategy-making ability and, thus, how to plan strategically given these conditions. Healey's strategy-making notion was applied to delimit a study of how size, finances, development path, and water organization influence Swedish municipalities' strategy-making ability for urban water. Three municipalities, Laxa, Norrkoping, and Skelleftea, with different, yet overlapping, institutional and socio-economic conditions were analyzed using semi-structured interviews, a stakeholder workshop, and document analyses. The study finds that even though key events have filtered urban water issues into the political agenda, this has not induced systemic change, except where the role of water management in urban development has been specified, i.e., has aligned dispersed planning processes. Organizational setup influences the strategy-making ability by prescribing not only when water issues are raised, but also what system perspective should be applied and what actors that should be enrolled. Judging from the three cases, size, finances, and development path do matter for strategy-making ability, but they appear to be less important than the organizational setup. Departures for improving strategy-making under different conditions are discussed.",10.3390/w10081102,Water,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
209,Participatory Vulnerability Reduction (PVR): an urban community-based approach for earthquake management,Rahman et al.,2018-01-01,"Participation of local people during any disaster is enormous. They possess better knowledge and information about their own community than anyone else from the outside. This study proposes Participatory Vulnerability Reduction (PVR), a community-based approach for disaster management. The concept of PVR was applied to an urban community of Dhaka city (Ward no. 06 of Dhaka North City Corporation) which has been identified by the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme as one of the most vulnerable areas of the city for earthquake. PVR consists three steps, and in each step, different participatory urban appraisal tools were used. In the first step, the community people assessed the earthquake vulnerability. It was found that some certain parts of the study area are highly vulnerable due to lack of accessibility to the critical facilities, inadequacy of open space, poor construction practice and unsuitable soil condition for building construction. This was followed by analyzing the root causes and effects of these problems. Structural fragility of the buildings, construction of settlements by filling the low-lying areas and development of slums beside taller buildings are the three major causes behind the above vulnerable issues. In the second step, capacity of the community was assessed in terms of resources and their organizational structure. In the final step, local people developed the strategies to overcome the vulnerability and a community-based organizational set up was proposed to coordinate the collective actions. Although developed in local context, application of PVR is not limited for earthquake and it can be replicated for other communities as well.",10.1007/s11069-018-3364-2,Natural Hazards,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
210,Stimulating urban transition and transformation to achieve sustainable and resilient cities,Mendizabal et al.,2018-01-01,"Political decision-makers need to consider the various challenges and opportunities that climate change can bring, and they must take decisions under high uncertainty to achieve resilient cities. Here, we synthesise the push and pull approaches reported in the literature and employed in practice to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. First, we present a literature review which identified the major research fields on transition theories, frameworks and methods that underpin this concept. We analyse the conditions for change, identify enablers or triggers for change at governance level for transitioning a city towards sustainability and resilience. We discuss the theories, frameworks and methods which can be used to address the urban climate change challenge at city level. Second, we present an empirical approach based on stakeholder participation that we conducted to detect the conditions for change. We report on the design and implementation of stakeholder exercises that helped us detecting the conditions for changes. Third, we combine the information obtained from these stakeholder exercises with that extracted from the literature in order to provide a fuller picture on how stimulate the transition and transformation to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. Based on our literature review and empirical approach, we formulate an integrated conceptual model for transition that enables the design of adaptation (and mitigation) strategies that consider the triggers of change. Uniquely we identified 8 triggers of change, including authority and political leadership, learning from disasters, co-responsibility, increased public-private interface, social participation and the living lab approach to innovation. The proposed model can be applied to the whole city or to a certain sector of the city (e.g. energy). We demonstrate that triggers of change help to overcome planning and implementation barriers and move the socio-ecological and socio-technical systems of any city towards those of a resilient city.",10.1016/j.rser.2018.06.003,Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
211,Traditional Farming and Sustainable Development of an Indigenous Community in the Mountain Area-A Case Study of Wutai Village in Taiwan,Ba et al.,2018-01-01,"The present study aimed to explore traditional farming and its role in sustainable development of the mountainous area based on the indigenous community of Wutai in Taiwan as a case study. It adopted qualitative methods with an ethnographic orientation, to conduct in-depth interviews, participant observation, and focus groups as an integral component of public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), and aerial photo analysis to collect and analyze field data, mainly in 2013 and 2017. The results revealed the continuation of traditional farming practices guided by the traditional farming calendar and characterized by mixed cropping, inter cropping, and rotation, which optimized the use of limited arable lands in the area. These practices also contributed to maximizing and securing local food supply, and maintaining endemic crop varieties. The results suggested that traditional farming offered a way to overcome the limitation of modern agriculture and support ecotourism as a sustainable alternative to mass tourism, by preserving crop diversity, social institutions and cultural traditions, and stabilizing the local environment. Furthermore, our findings showed that traditional farming, in keeping with local capacity, was adaptable to the impacts of climate change. In the last two decades, a returning tide of young residents and retired people involved in traditional farming might play a key role in the slowing down of the loss of agricultural lands in Wutai, influenced by the fashion of healthy foods and environments, as well as development of local ecotourism industry. Learned from this study, while there would be some opportunity for traditional farming to be recognized as one of the key components to promote the sustainable development of indigenous villages in mountain areas, more policy incentives might be considered.",10.3390/su10103370,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The strength of ECHO stems from the integration of a detailed representation of local hydrological and technological constraints with regional and global policies, while accounting for the feedbacks between water, energy, and agricultural sectors. In this study, ECHO has been applied over Africa as a case study with the aim of demonstrating the benefits of this integrated hydroeconomic modeling framework. Results of this framework are overall consistent with previous findings evaluating the cost of water supply and adaptation to global changes in Africa. Moreover, results provide critical assessments of future investment needs in both supply- and demand-side water management options, economic implications of contrasting future socioeconomic and climate change scenarios, and the potential trade-offs among economic and environmental objectives. Overall, this study demonstrates the capacity of ECHO to address challenging research questions examining the sustainability of water supply and the impacts of water management on energy and food sectors and vice versa. As such, we propose ECHO as useful tool for water-related scenario analysis and management options evaluation.",10.1029/2017WR022478,Water Resources Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
213,Moving forward in implementing green infrastructures: Stakeholder perceptions of opportunities and obstacles in a major North American metropolitan area,Bissonnette et al.,2018-01-01,"Urbanization poses both challenges and opportunities for the management of urban ecosystems globally. In the Greater Montreal Area (GMA), a major North American urban area where green infrastructure (GI) implementation is in its early stage, there are challenges in maintaining provision of ecosystem services due to urban expansion and climate change impacts. In response, stakeholders in the GMA are trying to further integrate the GI concept into planning practices and have participated in focus groups to discuss various approaches to implementing the GI concept. This paper addresses stakeholder perceptions of the opportunities and obstacles related to natural ecosystem management in the GMA. We discuss the way in which participants perceive the prospect of the GI concept to influence discourse and policy about environmental planning. We found plural perspectives on GI yet there was a broad consensus regarding problems in bringing planning tools in line with socio-ecological processes. This research provides a novel contribution by showing how the concept of GI informs narratives about metropolitan green space and environmental planning. The narratives of most research participants emphasised: 1) that efforts to protect and enhance the urban ecosystem should be approached within a coherent social and ecological framework at the scale of the metropolitan area, and 2) that GI planning needed to rely on collaborative and participatory approaches to enhance ecosystem services at all scales of the GMA.",10.1016/j.cities.2018.03.014,Cities,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
214,The Influence of Administrative Traditions and Governance on Private Involvement in Urban Climate Change Adaptation,Klein and Juhola,2018-01-01,"This qualitative study examines how administrative traditions and governance in two cities, New York City and Helsinki, have affected the interplay of public administration, the private sector, and citizens in climate change adaptation. The results show that both cities aim for an increased state-market-civil society interaction. However, their efforts have different points of departure and follow different trajectories. New York City's administration is within the Anglo-American tradition of state-market dualism, while the state-market-civil society interaction for adaptation is coordinated by newly created administrative organizations. This interaction has to be accommodated to the strong reliance on market mechanisms. Helsinki's administration has its roots in the welfare state administration with a strong role of the public administration. Increased state-market-civil society interaction results in a reduced influence of the public sector and the reliance on ad hoc projects and informal modes of cross-sectoral cooperation.",10.1111/ropr.12294,Review of Policy Research,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
215,Beyond traditional ecological restoration on the Colorado Plateau,Winkler et al.,2018-01-01,"The Colorado Plateau is one of North America's five major deserts, encompassing 340,000 km(2) of the western United States, and offering many opportunities for restoration relevant to researchers and land managers in drylands around the globe. The Colorado Plateau is comprised of vast tracts of public land managed by local, state, and federal agencies that oversee a wide range of activities (e.g., mineral and energy extraction, livestock grazing, and recreation). About 75% of the Plateau is managed by federal and tribal agencies and tens of millions of people visit the Plateau's public lands each year. However, even in the face of this diverse use, our knowledge of effective ways to restore Plateau ecosystems remains relatively poor. Further, the multiple agencies on the Plateau have mandates that differ greatly in allowable practices, restoration needs, and desired outcomes. The Colorado Plateau is also expected to undergo ecosystem shifts in the face of climate change, further complicating management decisions and potentially limiting some options while creating others. Here, we explore the current state of Colorado Plateau restoration science and underscore key challenges and opportunities for improving our capacity to maintain the myriad of services provided by these desert ecosystems. We highlight past research efforts and future needs related to restoration concepts, including consideration and design of novel ecosystems, mitigation for and adaptation to climate change, use of genetically diverse seed adapted for current and future conditions, and the value of strong multi-agency and stakeholder collaborations in restoring systems on the Colorado Plateau and beyond.",10.1111/rec.12876,Restoration Ecology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
216,Challenges to implementing bottom-up flood risk decision analysis frameworks: how strong are social networks of flooding professionals?,Knighton et al.,2018-01-01,"Recent developments in bottom-up vulnerabilitybased decision analysis frameworks present promising opportunities for flood practitioners to simplify complex decisions regarding risk mitigation and climate adaptation. This family of methodologies relies on strong social networks among flood practitioners and the public to support careful definition of stakeholder-relevant thresholds and vulnerabilities to hazards. In parallel, flood researchers are directly considering distinct atmospheric mechanisms that induce flooding to readily incorporate information on future climate projections. We perform a case study of flood professionals actively engaged in flood risk mitigation within Tompkins County, New York, USA, a community dealing with moderate flooding, to gage how much variance exists among professionals from the perspective of establishing a bottom-up flood mitigation study from an atmospheric perspective. Results of this case study indicate disagreement among flooding professionals as to which socioeconomic losses constitute a flood, disagreement on anticipated community needs, weak understanding of climate-weather-flood linkages, and some disagreement on community perceptions of climate adaptation. In aggregate, the knowledge base of the Tompkins County flood practitioners provides a well-defined picture of community vulnerability and perceptions. Our research supports the growing evidence that collaborative interdisciplinary flood mitigation work could reduce risk, and potentially better support the implementation of emerging bottomup decision analysis frameworks for flood mitigation and climate adaptation.",10.5194/hess-22-5657-2018,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

As scholarship on resilience and social-ecological transformations grows, researchers from various disciplines continue to debate how major transitions and environmental change can be anticipated, studied or guided towards just and ethical outcomes. To this end, we apply an interdisciplinary perspective to describing key aspects of social-ecological transformations scholarship around three pressing questions: (1) What features or criteria distinguish transformations from other forms of change?; (2) What are the political, ethical, and normative concerns associated with transformations?; and (3) How can we better track, measure, and evaluate such transformations? Our insights, which emerged from a workshop with early-career interdisciplinary scholars, highlight questions of justice, equity and ethics in transformations research, and suggest that more precise indicators of change, a more explicit understanding of system boundaries, and a dual focus on process and outcomes will help advance our understanding of the social-ecological implications of transformations.

To aid in developing targeted communication strategies, this exploratory study assessed how engaged state park users perceive climate change impacts and what they view as the agency role in climate change mitigation, education, and communication. Photo elicitation and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 members of the Missouri Parks Association (MPA), an advocacy group. While participants expressed concern about the threat of climate change to state parks, some doubted their ability to identify impacts. Despite this, participants accurately identified most of the regional threats predicted by experts, including increased flooding and drought, early blooming, invasive species, and extreme weather. Some reported that participation in the study inspired them to observe climate impacts more closely. Participants affirmed that state parks should lead climate change education and mitigation efforts, while acknowledging the challenges of addressing a politically charged subject. Regarding communication, MPA members recommend focusing on the science behind climate change and ecological mitigation. Although this study focused on Missouri state parks, results may be applicable to visitors in other Midwestern states. Management implications: Study participants supported managerial action on climate change adaptation through education and ecological management. They acknowledged the political challenges managers face. This study supports presenting scientific evidence to the public and framing climate-change communication around specific, resource-related impacts, especially vegetation, wildlife, and landscape themes that visitors identify as locally salient. Alternatively, park management could focus natural resource-based climate change education on the broader ecological benefits of environmental behavior. Staff can also highlighting environmental efforts underway in parks, such as adoption of energy efficient technology and landscape management practices aimed at increasing ecological resilience. Staff should be educated, empowered and encouraged to deliver locally-relevant climate change interpretation.",10.1016/j.jort.2018.09.002,Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism-Research Planning and Management,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
219,Engaging the Private Homeowner: Linking Climate Change and Green Stormwater Infrastructure,Beery,2018-01-01,"Current and projected climate change in the Minnesota Lake Superior Coastal Area indicates an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall. One key outcome of this change is a subsequent potential increase in stormwater runoff, a concern exacerbated by the region's shallow, often clay soils and exposed bedrock, along with highly impervious urban surfaces. This situation, coupled with public perception of climate change that is increasingly inclusive of severe weather, highlights an opportunity to apply green infrastructure to the challenge of stormwater management, referred to as green stormwater infrastructure. In addition to coordinated public action at local, state, and national levels, there is a role for the private landowner to participate in this form of climate adaptation. Private citizens have an opportunity to both protect their home and property while contributing to overall stormwater management for the community in which they live. Focus group research was conducted to better understand outreach and involve local residents in the creation of a tool to assist private green stormwater infrastructure efforts. Results of the focus group sessions were analyzed, and key themes emerged from the data to guide this process and support private home/landowner action. It is recommended that a fifth domain be added to the typology for public and private roles in climate adaptation, i.e. private adaptation for public and private benefit.",10.3390/su10124791,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
220,Conflicts in Transdisciplinary Research: Reviewing Literature and Analysing a Case of Climate Adaptation in Northwestern Germany,Siebenhuener,2018-01-01,"Transdisciplinary research has been introduced as an approach to integrate different bodies of knowledge to learn and to develop solutions towards socio-ecological transformations. In these concepts, broad stakeholder involvement is intended to promote knowledge integration, consensus formation and activation of local actors to initiate and advance learning and change processes. In doing so, however, transdisciplinary processes enter societal battlegrounds and meet conflicting interest and knowledge claims. Thus, building on the discussion on transdisciplinarity in the context of sustainability-related research, the paper seeks to understand when and why which types of conflicts emerge in sustainability-related transdisciplinary research, how they affect knowledge integration, and how they can be resolved. It develops a categorization of conflicts including differing values, conflicting interests, dissimilar claims of legitimacy, and diverse knowledge claims. They are applied empirically in the analysis of a project on regional adaptation to climate change in Northwestern Germany. It studies processes and outcomes with regard to the societal impact of the project and discusses experiences of conflicts and relevant solutions. The paper finds that societally relevant transdisciplinary research processes need to be prepared for conflict resolution and overcoming resistance and blockages in cases when consensus formation and mutual agreement is not attainable.",10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.07.011,Ecological Economics,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

Stakeholder engagement can help find common ground between environmental goals and the livelihood needs of local populations. A starting point for local stakeholder engagement is to gather insights into how forest management differentially impacts the livelihoods and well-being of these populations, which may be quite heterogeneous in their perspectives and livelihood needs. Towards this end, we conducted semi-structured first-person interviews in forest-dependent communities in Cameroon about perspectives on and suggestions about forest resources and management. This study provides insights into commonalities and differences of perspectives within and among local populations and supports the use of stakeholder engagement strategies that facilitate bidirectional communication and take into consideration diverse perspectives and priorities.",10.1007/s10745-018-0036-5,Human Ecology,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The rivers are of vital concern to India and Bangladesh as they provide fresh water for people, agriculture, industry, conservation and support the Delta System in the Bay of Bengal. Future changes in both climate and socio-economics have been investigated to assess whether these will alter river flows and water quality. Climate datasets down scaled from three different Global Climate Models have been used to drive a daily process based flow and water quality model. The results suggest that due to climate change the flows will increase in the monsoon period and also be enhanced in the dry season. However, once socio-economic changes are also considered, increased population, irrigation, water use and industrial development reduce water availability in drought conditions, threatening water supplies and posing a threat to river and coastal ecosystems. This study, as part of the DECCMA (Deltas, vulnerability and Climate Change: Migration and Adaptation) project, also addresses water quality issues, particularly nutrients (N and P) and their transport along the rivers and discharge into the Delta System. Climate will alter flows, increasing flood flows and changing pollution dilution factors in the rivers, as well as other key processes controlling water quality. Socio-economic change will affect water quality, as water diversion strategies, increased population and industrial development alter the water balance and enhance fluxes of nutrients from agriculture, urban centers and atmospheric deposition.( C) 2018 Elsevier BA,.

223,Strengthening insurance partnerships in the face of climate change - Insights from an agent-based model of flood insurance in the UK,Crick et al.,2018-01-01,"Multisectoral partnerships are increasingly cited as a mechanism to deliver and improve disaster risk management. Yet, partnerships are not a panacea and more research is required to understand the role that they can play in disaster risk management and particularly disaster risk reduction. This paper investigates how partnerships can incentivise flood risk reduction by focusing on the UK public-private partnership on flood insurance. Developing the right flood insurance arrangements to incentivise flood risk reduction and adaptation to climate change is a key challenge. In the face of rising flood risks due to climate change and socio-economic development insurance partnerships can no longer afford to focus only on the risk transfer function. However, while expectations of the insurance industry have traditionally been high when it comes to flood risk management, the insurance industry alone will not provide the solution to the challenge of rising risks. The case of flood insurance in the UK illustrates this: even national government and industry together cannot fully address these risks and other actors need to be involved to create strong incentives for risk reduction. Using an agent-based model focused on surface water flood risk in London we analyse how other partners could strengthen the insurance partnership by reducing flood risk and thus helping to maintain affordable insurance premiums. Our findings are relevant for wider discussions on the potential of insurance schemes to incentivise flood risk management and climate adaptation in the UK and also internationally.

224,Participatory early warning and monitoring systems: A Nordic framework for web-based flood risk management,Henriksen et al.,2018-01-01,"This paper reviews recent hydrological risk assessment, communication and early warning systems and proposes a framework to reformulate the classic view of Early Warning and Monitoring Systems towards a participatory one. The new framework is developed for flood risks (from multiple flood hazards), using examples from selected Nordic and other European countries. The study shows a potential for public participation in all stages of the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) cycle, with enhanced risk communication and awareness. Web-based access to hydrological data and nationwide modelling results can support adaptive and integrated management and learning about the flood risks on catchment scale. This can help identify cost-efficient solutions with synergy to other policy goals. The study shows how social media and digitalisation initiatives in the Nordic countries can support web-based access to historical data, real-time forecasts, and climate projections. Furthermore, the web-based access to data and model results can provide a coherent and integrated platform for stakeholder interaction and co-production for planning and decision-making that integrate hazard and risk knowledge. This can increase societal resilience and flood risk assessment across community and sector boundaries with proper analysis of risk areas, trade-off in costs and benefits of different solutions, and optimisation of climate change adaptation at the catchment scale.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2018.01.038,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
225,The role of the private sector and citizens in urban climate change adaptation: Evidence from a global assessment of large cities,Klein et al.,2018-01-01,"Expectations of cooperation between local authorities, the private sector, and citizens in climate change adaptation in cities are high because involvement of many actors is seen as critical to success. Scholars and policymakers argue that the private sector could be more efficient than the public authorities in implementing adaptation measures and argue for the need to engage citizens to ensure legitimacy of adaptation and inclusion of locally relevant knowledge. To what extent do cities address the private sector and citizens in their adaptation initiatives? What modes of governance do they use to do this? What kinds of cities are the most likely to address the private sector and citizens? Going beyond the existing case study approaches, this paper answers these questions using a large N data set covering 402 cities around the world. We find that a majority of adaptation initiatives focus exclusively on the public sector and do not address the private sector or citizens. In the cases where they do, the private sector is more often governed through partnerships and participation, whereas citizen participation is relatively rare. Initiatives involving citizens rely more often on a provision of information that encourages citizens to adapt. We find that the more advanced a city is in its adaptation process, the more likely it is to address the private sector than citizens in its initiatives to adapt to climate change. Whereas with partnerships and participation the private sector can influence urban adaptation arrangements at a broader scale, the provision of information allows citizens only to implement individual adaptation measures according to their capacities.",10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.012,Global Environmental Change-Human and Policy Dimensions,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,

The public understanding of climate change has become the prerequisite and basis for implementing various climate change policies. In order to explore the affected factors of climate change perception among Chinese residents, this study was conducted across 31 provinces and regions of China through field household surveys and interviews. Combined with the residents' perception of climate change with the possible affected factors, the related factors affecting Chinese residents' perception of climate change were explored. The results show that the perceptive level of climate change of Chinese residents is related to the education level and the household size of residents. Improving public awareness of climate change risk in the context of climate change through multiple channels will also help to improve residents' awareness of climate change. On the premise of improving the level of national education, improving education on climate change in school education and raising awareness of climate change risk among dependents will help to improve the level of Chinese residents' awareness of climate change, which could be instrumental in promoting public participation in climate change mitigation and adaptation actions.",10.3390/su10124712,Sustainability,2019-06-05 12:17:51+00:00,
228,Adaptation to Coastal Storms in Atlantic Canada: Implications and Lessons Learned,,2018-01-01,"In order to improve the resilience of social-ecological systems of small rural coastal communities in Atlantic Canada, we used different methodologies to not only increase awareness and understanding of what is climate change, but also to enhance public engagement and find solutions that are more appropriate to these communities. This entailed, for example, integrating scientific and existing knowledge. Communities need to be a part of planning and governance in order to identify the most important impacts and response measures. Local governance, from local service districts to municipal and support from the provincial government, are also considered essential in order to improve resilience in the study region. It is necessary to have both short-term (emergency) plans in effect as well as longer term planning for improved adaptation to increasing major storms. Adaptation measures have to consider any physicosocial aspects of hazards, with social responses integrated into physical and environmental hazard-proofing initiatives. Other suggestions are included here based on lessons learned from the research.",,,,162.0

The project was based on two main elements: a longitudinal study and participatory action research (PAR). The main goal of the longitudinal component of the project was to examine changes over time, while PAR aimed to co-produce knowledge and co-construct solutions with the communities. This was important in order to consider existing knowledge with scientific knowledge for more socially acceptable solutions. To do so, different tools were employed in the communities, depending on their interests and the issues that the communities wanted to work on in priority.",,,,123.0

The baseline and two contrasting climate change scenarios (with and without regional socio-economic change scenarios) were investigated. RegIS showed that climate change, without policy adaptation, could lead to severe flood impacts in East Anglia, and significant agricultural abandonment. Despite yield changes, cropping is generally insensitive to climate, but very sensitive to socio-economic change. There is increased seasonality to river flows, compounded by increased urbanisation and irrigation demand. The responses of biodiversity to climate change are regional, habitat and species-specific, but much of the future of biodiversity in these regions will depend on planned adaptation in the other sectors. Numerous examples of public engagement with the global change sphere represent the real outward value of RegIS, due to the significant uncertainties and limitations to knowledge in this first regional IA which prevented results of the detail, specificity and confidence that decision-makers required. However, with further investment and refinement, regional IA's will increasingly provide such output.",,,,198.0
231,Bridging the gap: empowering decision-making for adaptation through the,,2006-01-01,"The methods, tools and outputs of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) show how building adaptive capacity to climate change can be embedded within a wide range of organizations. UKCIP has been operating since 1997 to support decision-makers' assessments of their vulnerability to climate change so that they can plan how to adapt. Whilst stakeholder engagement is now generally regarded as vital to ensure that research meets the needs of decision-makers for information, this usually means that stakeholders are positioned in a 'consultative' role in research. In contrast, the UKCIP aims to bridge the gap between research and policy so that decision-makers take control to produce research in ways that are useful to them. The Programme has been flexible and was developed incrementally, with increased scientific understanding, taking advantage of collaborative funding and facilitating long-standing partnerships. Whilst the core framework of scenarios and tools has been developed centrally, most studies have been stakeholder-funded and led. The Programme's results suggest that if decision-makers are supported, capacity is built for assessments, and crucially, research outputs are directly applicable to their ongoing work and strategic planning. This capacity-building has worked across scales and sectors and is an effective route to mainstreaming climate change adaptation. The implication, therefore, is that more support should be given by funding agencies to develop institutional capacity to support adaptation to climate change in both the private and public sectors.",,,,231.0
232,The Value of Linking Mitigation and Adaptation: A Case Study of Bangladesh,,2009-01-01,"There are two principal strategies for managing climate change risks: mitigation and adaptation. Until recently, mitigation and adaptation have been considered separately in both climate change science and policy. Mitigation has been treated as an issue for developed countries, which hold the greatest responsibility for climate change, while adaptation is seen as a priority for the South, where mitigative capacity is low and vulnerability is high. This conceptual divide has hindered progress against the achievement of the fundamental sustainable development challenges of climate change. Recent attention to exploring the synergies between mitigation and adaptation suggests that an integrated approach could go some way to bridging the gap between the development and adaptation priorities of the South and the need to achieve global engagement in mitigation. These issues are explored through a case study analysis of climate change policy and practice in Bangladesh. Using the example of waste-to-compost projects, a mitigation-adaptation-development nexus is demonstrated, as projects contribute to mitigation through reducing methane emissions; adaptation through soil improvement in drought-prone areas; and sustainable development, because poverty is exacerbated when climate change reduces the flows of ecosystem services. Further, linking adaptation to mitigation makes mitigation action more relevant to policymakers in Bangladesh, increasing engagement in the international climate change agenda in preparation for a post-Kyoto global strategy. This case study strengthens the argument that while combining mitigation and adaptation is not a magic bullet for climate policy, synergies, particularly at the project level, can contribute to the sustainable development goals of climate change and are worth exploring.",,,,254.0
233,"Australian Universities, Government Research and the Application of Climate Change Knowledge in Australian Coastal Zone Management",,2010-01-01,"One of the key issues in Australia for sustainable management of the coastal zone is that the science of climate change has not been widely used by decision-makers to inform coastal governance. There exist opportunities to enhance the dialogue between knowledge-makers and decision-makers, and universities have a key role to play in researching and fostering better linkages. At the heart of these linkages lies the principle of more informed engagement between historically disparate groups. In Australia, the new 'Flagship' research programme, funded by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), emphasizes their partnering with universities in a more systematic and collaborative manner than previously achieved in such research projects. In order to address sustainability in general and coastal adaptation to climate change in particular, interdisciplinary learning needs to occur between the social and natural sciences; also, transdisciplinary understanding of that interaction needs to be fully developed. New methods of communicative engagement such as computer visualizations and animations, together with deliberative techniques, can help policy-makers and planners reach a better understanding of the significance of the science of climate change impacts on the coast. Deeper engagement across historically disparate groups can lead to the development of epistemological and methodological synergies between social and natural scientists, adaptive learning, reflexive governance, and greater analytical and deliberative understanding among scientists, policymakers and the wider public. This understanding can lead in turn to enhance coastal governance for climate adaptation on the coast.",,,,238.0

235,The New Climate Change Discourse: A Challenge for Environmental Sociology,,2010-01-01,"The chapter gives an analysis of the shifting social discourse on climate change in Germany and the U.S. Climate Change Discourses (CCD) are defined as thematically focused coupled sequences of arguments that different social actors use in order to influence one another or their social contexts in order to improve the chances of their resource endowments, interests, and worldviews to prevail in collective decision making processes. The major change in the recent CCD is seen as a shift from a framework of understanding the Earth System to a framework of decision making under uncertainties. The traditional (and in part ideological) opposition of mitigation and adaptation policies will have give way to an optimal mix of both. The chapter gives empirical evidence for that analysis from mass media coverage, public opinion, policy making, and the business sector. This shift occurs currently more markedly in Germany than in the U.S., will probably catch up across the Atlantic soon. The final section sketches the outlines of a low-carbon society and discusses some major challenges to environmental sociology such as more systemic views, active engagement in IPCC's working group III, risk analysis of climate solutions, critical assessments of socio-technical experiments.",,,,196.0

Inherent unpredictability, long-term timeframes, lack of directly tangible consequences or clearly identifiable villains, issues with credibility and vested interests and cost implications in an era of chronic economic uncertainty all combine to increase the likelihood of unsuccessful climate change policies and strategies. Additional complications arise within the tourism sector from the rudimentary state of knowledge about the relationships between the tourism and climate change, an apathetic and fickle travelling public and a reciprocally uncommitted tourism industry. I argue that adaptation is a rational business response to climate change that is not directly related to environmental and sociocultural sustainability, and that mitigation measures should be supported to the extent that they yield practical and tangible short- and medium-term benefits and address local sustainability issues such as air quality and biodiversity protection.",,,,156.0

With a growing majority of people living in cities, urban dwellers and municipal decision-makers will need to reduce their emissions and other impacts on the regional and global climate while dealing with the unavoidable near-term and potential longer-term impacts of climate change. To facilitate effective societal response to climate change, a busy, distracted, and so far only marginally interested public needs to be engaged on the topic. This poses significant challenges to communication and sustained outreach efforts. This letter draws on critical insights from a three-year multi-disciplinary project that involved academics and practitioners from various disciplines and sectors of (mostly US) society and explored how to communicate climate change in ways that facilitate societal response. The letter raises questions about key audiences, appropriate messengers, framings and messages, reception of climate change information, and the choice of communication mediums and formats to achieve different communication and engagement goals.",,,,157.0

Attention focuses on three regions covering a variety of environmental, social, economic, and political contexts and histories and located at key points along a north-south rainfall gradient: Chihuahua in the arid north, Oaxaca in the wetter south and Guanajuato located in the central Mexican highlands. A number of themes are considered. First, the significance of successive, prolonged, or combined climate events as triggers of agrarian crisis. Second, a case study demonstrating the national and regional impacts of a particularly devastating climate induced famine, culminating with the so-called 'Year of Hunger' between 1785 and 1786, is presented. The way in which social networks and community engagement were rallied as a means of fortifying social resilience to this and other crises will be highlighted. Third, the impacts of selected historical flood events are explored in order to highlight how the degree of impact of a flood was a function of public expectation, preparedness and also the particular socio-economic and environmental context in which the event took place. An overview of the spatial and temporal variations in vulnerability and resilience to climatic variability and extreme weather events in colonial Mexico is then provided, considering those recorded events that could potentially relate to broader scale, possibly global, climate changes.",,,,229.0
241,Community level adaptation to climate change: The potential role of participatory community risk assessment,,2008-01-01,"This paper explores the value of using community risk assessments (CRAs) for climate change adaptation. CRA refers to participatory methods to assess hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities in support of community-based disaster risk reduction, used by many NGOs, community-based organizations, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent. We review the evolution of climate change adaptation and community-based disaster risk reduction, and highlight the challenges of integrating global climate change into a bottom-up and place-based approach. Our analysis of CRAs carried out by various national Red Cross societies shows that CRAs can help address those challenges by fostering community engagement in climate risk reduction, particularly given that many strategies to deal with current climate risks also help to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Climate change can also be explicitly incorporated in CRAs by making better use of CRA tools to assess trends, and by addressing the notion of changing risks. However, a key challenge is to keep CRAs simple enough for wide application. This demands special attention in the modification of CRA tools; in the background materials and trainings for CRA facilitators; and in the guidance for interpretation of CRA outcomes. A second challenge is the application of a limited set of CRA results to guide risk reduction in other communities and to inform national and international adaptation policy. This requires specific attention for sampling and care in scaling up qualitative findings. Finally, stronger linkages are needed between organizations facilitating CRAs and suppliers of climate information, particularly addressing the translation of climate information to the community level.

242,"Public engagement in climate change - Disjunctions, tensions and blind spots in the UK",,2009-01-01,"There is much talk about engaging the public in climate change mitigation and adaptation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Governments rush to demand greater engagement of the public in tackling climate change and delivering sustainable futures. The importance that public engagement has gained as part of the UK climate agenda begs the questions of what is actually behind this call and what are the implications. This paper analyses the rationale for public engagement as enshrined in major policy documents. This rationale is clearly instrumental in that citizens are expected to engage by adopting the 'right attitude', by performing prescribed behaviours, and by consenting to proposed measures. Using recent cases of climate change mitigation and adaptation practice the paper discusses the implications of such an approach to public engagement. The paper concludes that until the manifold disjunctions between climate related policy agendas and their rationales for engagement are explicitly addressed citizen engagement will be serving incumbent interests rather than contributing to socially sustainable and democratic decision-making",,,,166.0
243,Igniting change in local government: lessons learned from a bushfire vulnerability assessment,,2009-01-01,"Local governments and communities have a critical role to play in adapting to climate variability and change. Spatial vulnerability assessment is one tool that can facilitate engagement between researchers and local stakeholders through the visualisation of climate vulnerability and the integration of its biophysical and socio-economic determinants. This has been demonstrated through a case study from Sydney, Australia where a bushfire vulnerability assessment was undertaken as the first-step in a project to investigate local government perceptions of climate vulnerability and adaptive capacity. A series of relevant biophysical and socio-economic indicators was identified that represented the region's exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity with respect to bushfires. These indicators were then combined to develop maps of net landscape vulnerability to bushfire. When presented in a workshop setting, vulnerability maps were successful in capturing the attention of stakeholders while simultaneously conveying information regarding the diversity of drivers that can contribute to current and future vulnerability. However, stakeholders were reluctant to embrace representations of vulnerability that differed from their own understanding of hazard, necessitating the demonstration of agreement between the vulnerability assessment and more conventional hazard assessment tools. This validation opened the door for public dissemination of vulnerability maps, the uptake and use of the assessment in local government risk assessment and adaptation planning, and more focused case-studies on barriers to adaptation.",,,,218.0

In this context individuals and the community level play a vital role, and there are also considerable expectations by citizens that national governments will take the lead. Yet engagement is slow, and this raises questions regarding the motivation for action and how to get widespread engagement, particularly at the local level. Some issues that have motivated action include experiencing the local impact of climate change and a realisation that it has a security impact (from many different perspectives from climate migration to socio-economic impacts). Studies that address the cost of action and inaction have placed climate change on the political map, and community leaders that have engaged from various angles such as improving air quality have gained multiple benefits for the community and the environment, as an indirect approach to local climate action. This chapter explores why the local level urgently needs to engage, and what its representatives - political leaders, staff and citizens - need to know about what they are dealing with, and why they should deal with it.",,,,201.0

Potential adaptation tactics were categorized according to their expected benefits and costs and led to the creation of working groups to develop action plans that will include primary actors, timelines, budgets, and performance measures that the City will monitor. While not essential for all cities, the impacts analysis was of high value to the adaptation strategy. However, a strategy for stakeholder engagement is crucial in ensuring that the implications of climate impacts are properly understood. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,167.0
246,Public perception of drought and climate change in southeast England,,2010-01-01,"Droughts occur as a natural feature of many climates. Several southern areas of the UK experienced water stress during 20042006 because of low water availability and high water demand. Climate change scenarios suggest that drought frequency could increase here in the future. This will increase the competition for water across all sectors. Understanding people's perceptions of drought and climate change is likely to be an important factor for sustainable water management by pointing to barriers to behavioural change. A mixed methodology study using questionnaires and focus groups was conducted in the Anglian and southern regions of the UK to explore public perceptions of drought and climate change. Respondents attributed the 2004-2006 regional drought to lower than average rainfall. Water-intensive lifestyles, a growth in population, increasing housing developments, leaking pipes and the privatization of water companies were also implicated. The majority of respondents claimed to change their behaviour to conserve water during 2006. Regarding the future, and under a number of different scenarios, people were more inclined to accept restrictions than agree to pay more to ensure the supply of water. They were concerned about climate change and recognized that more frequent water shortages may be one of the impacts, but this concern did not necessarily translate into action. Barriers to engagement with climate change and water-efficient behaviour included a lack of accessible information, a lack of knowledge regarding the integration of environmental spheres, a lack of resources, and a perceived lack of institutional engagement. The barriers identified appear to pose a major challenge to successful adaptation to climate change.",,,,259.0
247,Framing adaptation to climate-related extreme events,,2010-01-01,"Whilst mitigation has dominated policy and research agendas in recent years there is an increasing recognition that communities also need to be preparing for change that is unavoidable, partially a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases already emitted to the atmosphere. The perceived need for adaptation has also received additional impetus through the high public profile now given to the impacts of current day weather variability, particularly the significant economic and social costs associated with recent extreme events. However, being a relatively new focus for both research and policy communities; practical evidence of the extent, feasibility, efficiency, and cost effectiveness of potential adaptation options remains largely lacking. In response, this paper seeks to make a contribution to this embryonic but evolving knowledge base by considering the theoretical underpinnings of adaptation and ultimately how this translates into practice 'in the real world'. The analytical commentary, based on a bottom-up approach involving iterative engagement with key stakeholders and experts, reflects on the identification of measures that are either innovative or examples of good practice in reducing or transferring climate risks, as well as considering those 'enabling' institutional structures and processes that act to support implementation on the ground. The paper concludes by synthesising the key findings to date in order to highlight some of the opportunities for, and barriers to, adaptation activity.",,,,219.0
248,"Preparing Communities for the Impacts of Climate Change in Oregon, USA",,2011-01-01,"No matter how fast society reduces greenhouse gases, rising temperatures will produce significant ecological, social, health, and economic consequences. Few public or private organizations in the US, however, have the capacity to effectively prepare for or adapt to these inevitable changes. Unless the public and private sectors begin now to prepare for these impacts, great harm and high costs will result. The Climate Leadership Initiative at the University of Oregon, with partners, instituted a multi-year programme to develop a model that can be replicated nationwide for (a) analysing potential climate impacts at the basin scale; (b) engaging government agencies and stakeholders involved with natural (e.g. landscapes, streams, and biodiversity), human (e.g. emergency response, health care, education), built (e.g. transport, irrigation, communications infrastructure and buildings), and economic (e.g. forestry, agriculture, manufacturing, tourism) systems in assessing what those likely impacts mean for their sectors; (c) helping the agencies and stakeholders develop strategies and policies to prepare their systems to withstand and adapt to climate change through methods that enhance, and not undermine, climate preparation efforts in the other sectors. We began with pilot programmes in the Rogue and Upper Willamette river basins of Oregon. We are now working in the Klamath Basin of Oregon and California and will soon move to the national level with model programmes in three to four locations across the country. Our goal is to dramatically increase climate preparation and adaptation literacy and to build and deliver the tools and resources needed to assist all levels of governments, institutions and non-profits across the nation to proactively prepare for climate change.",,,,262.0
249,Overview: Adaptive Management for the Health Risks of Climate Change,,2011-01-01,"Climate change is expected to increase health risks in all countries. Although public health agencies and organizations have impressive records of controlling the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes, current and planned programs and activities may need to be modified to address the additional risks of climate change. Programs and activities need to take an iterative risk management approach if they are to maintain current levels of health burdens as diseases change their geographic range and incidence in response to changing temperature and precipitation patterns and as the risks of adverse health outcomes from extreme weather events increase. Public health can learn from the experiences in ecosystem management with adaptive management, a structured and iterative process of decision-making in the face of imperfect information, with an aim of reducing uncertainty through monitoring and evaluation. Although many of the steps in adaptive management are familiar to public health, key differences include: a stronger emphasis on stakeholder engagement; taking a systems-based approach; developing interventions based on models of future impacts; and a strong and explicit focus on iterative management that can facilitate the capacity for further adaptation. Incorporating these elements into public health programs and activities will increase their effectiveness to address the health risks of climate change.",,,,205.0
250,One model fits all? On the moderating role of emotional engagement and confusion in the elicitation of preferences for climate change adaptation policies,,2011-01-01,"Environmental economic and psychological studies often implicitly assume homogeneity of respondents' decision strategies in questionnaire-based surveys. However, social psychology and behavioural research suggest that there is a wide variety of approaches that individuals use to make such choices. We explore this heterogeneity against the backdrop of so-called dual process models', analysing participants' responses in a survey of public beliefs about and preferences for climate change adaptation policies. We find that the postulate of two different types of decision-making, the systematic-analytical and the heuristic-holistic, does indeed help us to understand patterns in respondent behaviour that are, in turn, underpinned by respondents' motivation and ability to process information. Participants who were motivated and able to process the information provided were more likely to express preferences in line with their beliefs about adaptation policies, whereas those less motivated and more confused were more likely to use generalised rules-of-thumb that were not specific to the policy issue at hand. Depending on the theoretical framework of a study, such heterogeneity in response consistency and use of generic rules-of-thumb might have implications for the usefulness of survey outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings, and draw conclusions for survey-based environmental research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,203.0
251,Adaptation in agriculture: lessons for resilience from eastern regions of New Zealand,,2011-01-01,"Assessments of adaptation in agriculture have evolved considerably from early, top-down, impact assessments. These early assessments, internationally and in New Zealand, provided a limited view of 'smart farmer' adaptation. While impact assessment provides some useful insights, experience with vulnerability and adaptation assessment provides a more appropriate foundation for understanding and characterising practical smart farmer adaptation. Findings are presented from 8 years of engagement with farmers in eastern regions of New Zealand. A comprehensive farm resilience picture has emerged from this work. This picture reflects a strong belief from real-world smart farmers that there is sufficient knowledge and experience to adapt to climate change. Proactive farmers are already reading multiple signals, including changes in climate, and are responding. The farm resilience picture provides a foundation for exploring alternative adaptation options and pathways for agriculture. These are presented and discussed in response to two proposed climate change scenarios, a high carbon world scenario and a rapidly decarbonising world scenario. Knowledge intensive, low input systems are consistent with the resilience picture drawn from farmers. Such systems are also consistent with a rapidly decarbonising world scenario and, it is argued, are likely to become increasingly attractive under a high carbon world scenario. A smart farming approach, focused on resilience, provides the basis for development of a response capacity, with potentially significant co-benefits in terms of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Wider issues and needs to support the further development of farm resilience, and more widely landscape or regional resilience, are identified and discussed. It is apparent from this work that ongoing engagement with smart farmers, focused on resilience, can contribute significantly to development of a coordinated 'bottom up' and 'top down' response capacity. Addressing the psychology of change is a fundamental need to ensure wider engagement.",,,,293.0
252,"Putting vulnerability to climate change on the map: a review of approaches, benefits, and risks",,2011-01-01,"There is growing demand among stakeholders across public and private institutions for spatially-explicit information regarding vulnerability to climate change at the local scale. However, the challenges associated with mapping the geography of climate change vulnerability are non-trivial, both conceptually and technically, suggesting the need for more critical evaluation of this practice. Here, we review climate change vulnerability mapping in the context of four key questions that are fundamental to assessment design. First, what are the goals of the assessment? A review of published assessments yields a range of objective statements that emphasize problem orientation or decision-making about adaptation actions. Second, how is the assessment of vulnerability framed? Assessments vary with respect to what values are assessed (vulnerability of what) and the underlying determinants of vulnerability that are considered (vulnerability to what). The selected frame ultimately influences perceptions of the primary driving forces of vulnerability as well as preferences regarding management alternatives. Third, what are the technical methods by which an assessment is conducted? The integration of vulnerability determinants into a common map remains an emergent and subjective practice associated with a number of methodological challenges. Fourth, who participates in the assessment and how will it be used to facilitate change? Assessments are often conducted under the auspices of benefiting stakeholders, yet many lack direct engagement with stakeholders. Each of these questions is reviewed in turn by drawing on an illustrative set of 45 vulnerability mapping studies appearing in the literature. A number of pathways for placing vulnerability mapping on a more robust footing are also identified.",,,,256.0
253,Preventing cold-related morbidity and mortality in a changing climate,,2011-01-01,"Winter weather patterns are anticipated to become more variable with increasing average global temperatures. Research shows that excess morbidity and mortality occurs during cold weather periods. We critically reviewed evidence relating temperature variability, health outcomes, and adaptation strategies to cold weather. Health outcomes included cardiovascular-, respiratory-, cerebrovascular-, and all-cause morbidity and mortality. Individual and contextual risk factors were assessed to highlight associations between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics that contribute to a person's vulnerability to variability in cold weather events. Epidemiologic studies indicate that the populations most vulnerable to variations in cold winter weather are the elderly, rural and, generally, populations living in moderate winter climates. Fortunately, cold-related morbidity and mortality are preventable and strategies exist for protecting populations from these adverse health outcomes. We present a range of adaptation strategies that can be implemented at the individual, building, and neighborhood level to protect vulnerable populations from cold-related morbidity and mortality. The existing research justifies the need for increased outreach to individuals and communities for education on protective adaptations in cold weather. We propose that future climate change adaptation research couple building energy and thermal comfort models with epidemiological data to evaluate and quantify the impacts of adaptation strategies.

254,New social directions in UK flood risk management: moving towards flood risk citizenship?,,2011-01-01,"This paper explores the evolution of a more sociotechnical variety of flood and coastal risk management (FCRM) in the UK that emphasises community engagement and personal or community level responsibility for flood risk planning, awareness and resilience alongside more traditional, centrally managed structural and technical measures. Specifically, it explores three interlocking drivers of the social turn in UK FCRM: (i) the need to adapt to climate change and address the lessons from associated high profile flood events; (ii) pressures to integrate FCRM with the sustainable development agenda; and (iii) a broader trend towards a civic model in UK environmental policy-making and delivery. The paper also explores the practical impact and manifestation of these drivers in current FCRM planning and delivery frameworks, and suggests several critical pathways for a deeper embedding of the approach.",,,,133.0
255,Managed retreat of coastal communities: understanding responses to projected sea level rise,,2012-01-01,"Managed retreat - the relocation of homes and infrastructure under threat from coastal flooding - is one of the few policy options available for coastal communities facing long-term risks from accelerated sea level rise. At present, little is known about how the Australian public perceives policy options to mitigate sea level rise risks. This paper explores a range of different decision-making criteria used to assess a managed retreat scheme. A metatheoretical social functionalist framework is used to make sense of personal concerns elicited from an online survey asking respondents to consider a managed retreat scheme. The framework proposes that people can act intuitively as scientists, economists, politicians, prosecutors and theologians, when considering a complex topic such as managed retreat policy. The research found that the survey respondents are more likely to consider the topic of managed retreat from multiple functional perspectives than from a single functional perspective. The type of social functionalist frameworks that people used to assess the Conditional Occupancy Rights scheme was found to be influenced by their perceptions of sea level rise risk. The findings have implications for public debates about the long-term risks of sea level rise and for engaging with the community about managed retreat policy options.",,,,202.0
256,"Public understanding of, and attitudes to, climate change: UK and international perspectives and policy",,2012-01-01,"Although levels of concern and awareness about climate change have been rising in many nations over the past 20 years, climate change remains of low importance relative to other global or personal issues. Powerful contextual barriers act to prevent public engagement with it, such as psychological distancing and externalized responsibility. Despite extensive media coverage of the issue since 2006 there was a gradual decrease in public concern between 2006 and 2010. Possible explanations are issue fatigue, the impact of the global financial crisis, distrust, and the deepening politicization of the issue. Risk and uncertainty will become part of the debate about climate change policy in the future. Although engaging both the public and decision makers needs to draw upon the best guidance already developed in communicating risk, it is also likely that a radical reframing of the terms of public debate and new approaches to 'risk communication' will be needed. The most significant risk to achieving ambitious climate mitigation and adaptation goals appears to be the 'governance trap' engendered by current national and international systems of governance, such that the public and governments each seek to attribute responsibility for instigating change to the other.",,,,194.0
257,"Conceptualising climate change in rural Australia: community perceptions, attitudes and (in)actions",,2012-01-01,"Public engagement and support is essential for ensuring adaptation to climate change. The first step in achieving engagement is documenting how the general public currently perceive and understand climate change issues, specifically the importance they place on this global problem and identifying any unique challenges for individual communities. For rural communities, which rely heavily on local agriculture industries, climate change brings both potential impacts and opportunities. Yet, to date, our knowledge about how rural residents conceptualise climate change is limited. Thus, this research explores how the broader rural community-not only farmers-conceptualises climate change and responsive activities, focussing on documenting the understandings and risk perceptions of local residents from two small Australian rural communities. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted in communities in the Eden/Gippsland region on the border of New South Wales and Victoria and the north-east of Tasmania. There are conflicting views on how climate change is conceptualised, the degree of concern and need for action, the role of local industry, who will 'win' and 'lose', and the willingness of rural communities to adapt. In particular, residents who believed in anthropogenic or human-induced factors described the changing climate as evidence of 'climate change', whereas those who were more sceptical termed it 'weather variability', suggesting that there is a divide in rural Australia that, unless urgently addressed, will hinder local and national policy responses to this global issue. Engaging these communities in the twenty-first-century climate change debate will require a significant change in terminology and communication strategies.",,,,246.0
258,"Climate Change Communication: A Provocative Inquiry into Motives, Meanings, and Means",,2012-01-01,"The deliberately provocative theme of this article is that perceived difficulties in climate change communication (CCC)e.g., indifference about or denial of climate change's reality, negative consequences, anthropogenic causes, or need to mitigate or adapt to itare partly the fault of climate change communicators. Fischhoff's model of risk communication development is used to demonstrate that CCC to date has tended to stress persuasion, rather than social movement mobilization or deliberation, and with a focus on the model's early stages. Later stages are not necessarily better, but a more diverse strategy seems superior to a focus perhaps narrowed by empathic, ideological, psychological, and resource constraints. Furthermore, even within persuasion, emphasizing a wider set of values, consequences, and audiences could be fruitful. Social movement mobilization has its own set of weaknesses, but usefully complements persuasion with a focus on developing power, subverting mainstream assumptions, and engaging people in collective action. Deliberation similarly has its drawbacks, but unlike the other two approaches does not define the solutionor even, necessarily, the problemin advance, and thus offers the chance for people of contending viewpoints to jointly develop concepts and action agendas hitherto unimagined. Simultaneous pursuit of all three strategies can to some degree offset their respective flaws, at the potential cost of diffusion of energies and contradictory messages. Success in CCC is by no means guaranteed by a more diverse set of strategies and self-reflection by communicators, but their pursuit should better reveal CCC's limits.",,,,239.0
259,National Climate Change Policies and Sustainable Water Management: Conflicts and Synergies,,2011-01-01,"Even in the absence of climate change, freshwater ecosystems and the resources they provide for people are under great pressure because of increasing demand for water and declines in water quality. The imminent onset of climate change will exacerbate these impacts, placing even greater pressure on already stressed resources and regions. A plethora of national climate change policies have been adopted that emphasize structural adjustment in the energy sector and increasing carbon sinks. To date, most public debate on water has focused on the direct impacts of climate change on hydrology. However, there is growing evidence that climate change policies themselves may have substantial additional and negative impacts on freshwater resources and ecosystems and may thus result in maladaptation. To avoid such maladaptation, integrated, coordinated policy making is required. In this paper, national climate change policies from Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union (EU), India, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom are compared to: (i) identify where negative trade-offs exist between climate change policies and freshwater resources, (ii) analyze where institutions and structures exist to optimize integration among climate, water, and biodiversity policies, and (iii) provide a much needed overview from a broad selection of countries with a view to identifying further opportunities for theoretical exploration and testing. The synergies and conflicts among climate, energy, water, and environmental policies create additional challenges for governments to develop integrated policies to deliver multiple benefits. Success factors for better policy development identified in this assessment and synthesis include engagement of senior political leaders, cyclical policy development, multi-agency and stakeholder processes, and stronger accountability and enforcement measures.",,,,265.0
260,Making sense of what enables and what constrains adaptation to climate change,,2011-01-01,"As a first step in responding to new phenomena such as climate change people need to make sense of these new phenomena. Social representations theory suggests that people first anchor new phenomena to what they already know and then through processes of social interaction such as conversation or engagement with public media, people objectify this anchored representation in the form of an image, metaphor or symbol. This objectification makes the phenomenon familiar and part of common sense. As such the objectified phenomenon is added as a new social object to the group's world. The social representations form an important underpinning feature of how people respond to phenomena such as climate change. The process of making sense of phenomena such as climate change is thus very much a social process and we need to understand how this process occurs in order to effectively model people's responses. In a similar vein, to understand how people respond to climate change we need to make sense of how they make sense of the situations they face; what enables and what constrains their ability to adapt to climate change. These enabling and constraining factors need to be understood as objects within the social world. Making sense of new phenomena is a highly complex process. As society grapples with making sense of climate change and having to adapt to climate change it is very difficult to predict what social objects will emerge and become objectified. This is a truly difficult situation to model. To build models of the social dimensions of climate change we will need as a first step, to be able to model this highly complex sense making process through which groups within, and society as a whole come to terms with climate change and what enables them to adapt to climate change. In this paper we describe some preliminary results from our investigations of sense making in relation to climate change and climate change adaptation among different social groups. Our data compromise almost 1000 narrative fragments of people's personal experiences of what enables and what constrains adaptation to climate change. We present some preliminary findings of patterns in how society in Australia and Canada, are making sense of adapting to climate change. Respondents in our survey revealed characteristics of their narratives and their own relationship to their narrative as well as a number of characteristics of themselves. We present preliminary results of mixed methods analysis of word association and narrative fragment data on what people think of in relation to climate change and in which factors help and which hinder adaptation to climate change. An important conclusion emerging from our preliminary analyses of the data was that there was no one consensual representation either of climate change or the factors that enable or constrain adaptation to climate change. The paper concludes by identifying some opportunities and difficulties that our analyses present for modelling the social dimensions of climate change.",,,,486.0
261,Entering the Period of Consequences: The Explosive US Awakening to the Need for Adaptation,,2011-01-01,"Since the early years of the twenty-first century, the United States has been awakening rapidly to the fact that climate change is underway and that adaptation to the unavoidable impacts of climate change is needed and must be begun now. This chapter provides an historical overview of the public, political, and scientific concern with adaptation in America. It begins by describing the shift from the early concerns with climate change and adaptation to the more recent awakening to the need for a comprehensive approach to managing the risks from climate change, as reflected in the news media. This shift is evident from the recent debates and drafting of adaptation-related bills in Congress; to the rapidly expanding activities at the state and local government levels; to the increasing engagement of nongovernmental organizations, professional associations, scientists, and consultants. This policy rush is not underlain, however, by widespread public engagement and mobilization, nor does it rest on a solid research foundation. To help the United States prepare adequately for the impacts of climate change, funding for vulnerability and adaptation research must be significantly increased. This will facilitate establishing adequate decision support mechanisms; effective communication and public involvement; and building the necessary capacity in science, the consulting world, and in government agencies.",,,,208.0
262,CoastRanger MS: A Tool for Improving Public Engagement,,2011-01-01,"Over the next century, ongoing coastal change will require a change in the way flood and erosion risks are managed in some areas. Such changes may have significant effects on local stakeholders and may require varying degrees of adaptation. It is therefore important for these stakeholders to be able to enter fully into the consultation process associated with these issues. This paper describes an innovative approach to stimulate public debate and improve stakeholder understanding of the issues that need to be balanced in order to achieve sustainable long-term coastal management solutions. The approach involves the creation of an educational tool (Coast Ranger MS) that allows users to manage a virtual coast within a PC-gaming type environment. Coast Ranger MS incorporates a legacy of past developments and defences, and uses a coastal process simulator to predict the impacts of climate change under different management scenarios chosen by the user. In the UK, it is anticipated that the tool will be of particular value in educating stakeholders before and during the development of strategic coastal management plans.",,,,175.0

This paper describes a conceptual framework to meet these requirements by generating alternative, coherent, holistic climate change scenarios and visualizations at the local scale, in collaboration with local stakeholders and scientists. The framework provides a template for a process to integrate emission scenarios with both mitigation and adaptation strategies, and to link local manifestations of impacts and responses with global climate change scenarios. The article outlines the empirical application of this framework in the Local Climate Change Visioning Project in British Columbia, Canada. The project collaboratively localized, spatialized, and visualized possible climate change effects and community responses in the community's 'backyards'.

266,Public responses to climate change: The role of deliberation in building capacity for adaptive action,,2011-01-01,"Public deliberative platforms have been argued as potentially beneficial in fostering adaptive capacity to respond to climate change. However, little is known about the veracity of such claims, and indeed how deliberation and adaptive capacity can and do intersect. In response, this paper reports on findings from a project into public responses to climate change in the Australian Capital Region. It utilises quantitative analysis-in the form of Q methodology-and qualitative analysis, to compare discourses that emerged from individual scenario-based interviews with those that emerged at the end of a 4-day public deliberative process. It shows that while the scenario interviews had an impact on participants, this impact is not sustained. By contrast, the deliberative process gave rise to new discourses, one of which (labelled 'Collective Action Imperative') is argued as indicative of a potentially constructive personal and collective adaptive capacity. However, advocating deliberative processes still requires caution, as less adaptive discourses prevailed, suggesting strong governance signals and leadership are still essential for fostering a positive public response to the challenges of climate change.

This contribution focuses on how citizens can engage in developing answers in fighting climate change and adapting to its impacts. Employing the function model of civil society developed by Merkel and Lauth, it draws on practical experience revealed by concrete examples and offers a systematization of the roles and functions that civil society can play in combating climate change. Examples of successful civic engagement on the community and national levels cover different perspectives and entry points, such as human rights, environmental and energy issues, and consumer protection. Transitions to stable democracy have become the object of significant international democracy support, so the account concludes that democracy's international supporters must understand the complexity that climate change brings to livelihoods at the community level and the potential benefits of pursuing greater interaction with civic engagement at the local and national levels.",,,,162.0
269,"The role of knowledge, learning and mental models in public perceptions of climate change related risks",,2012-01-01,"Climate change represents a complex set of challenges, in part because it is marked by risks that are not easily observed and identified - risks that humans have significant difficulty estimating. A large body of research has shown that the construction of human risk perception is a complex, multi-faceted process. Determining viable mitigation and adaptation strategies toward climate change risks therefore necessitates models that appropriately reflect human knowledge systems and learning processes. In learning for a sustainable future, we must look beyond traditional measures of risk variables and obtain a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of risk behaviour. In this chapter, we aim to provide such an interdisciplinary overview. Using practical examples we outline five fundamental processes that help form, shape and guide human perceptions of climate-related risks, namely: (1) cognitive; (2) subconscious; (3) affective; (4) socio-cultural and (5) individual factors. We subsequently critically review techniques for measuring risk perception, discuss (existing) public perceptions of climate change related risks and illuminate the different mechanisms by which risk perception can influence public action. A major conclusion is that eliciting effective adaptation and mitigation responses requires greater public understanding of and multi-level engagement with climate change and to this extent, we provide several recommendations for public policy.",,,,205.0
270,Climate Change Risk Perception and Communication: Addressing a Critical Moment?,,2012-01-01,"Climate change is an increasingly salient issue for societies and policy-makers worldwide. It now raises fundamental interdisciplinary issues of risk and uncertainty analysis and communication. The growing scientific consensus over the anthropogenic causes of climate change appears to sit at odds with the increasing use of risk discourses in policy: for example, to aid in climate adaptation decision making. All of this points to a need for a fundamental revision of our conceptualization of what it is to do climate risk communication. This Special Collection comprises seven papers stimulated by a workshop on Climate Risk Perceptions and Communication held at Cumberland Lodge Windsor in 2010.

271,A public health frame arouses hopeful emotions about climate change,,2012-01-01,"Communication researchers and practitioners have suggested that framing climate change in terms of public health and/or national security may make climate change more personally relevant and emotionally engaging to segments of the public who are currently disengaged or even dismissive of the issue. To evaluate these assumptions, using a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N = 1,127) conducted in December, 2010, we randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions. Subjects were asked to read uniquely framed news articles about climate change emphasizing either the risks to the environment, public health, or national security and the benefits of mitigation and adaptation-related actions. Results show that across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Findings also indicated that the national security frame may possibly boomerang among audience segments already doubtful or dismissive of the issue, eliciting unintended feelings of anger.",,,,165.0
272,"Rising sea and threatened mangroves: a case study on stakeholders, engagement in climate change communication and non-formal education",,2012-01-01,"Scientific consensus shows that the changes related to climate change are already occurring and will intensify in the future. This will likely result in significant alterations to coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, increase coastal hazards and affect lifestyles of coastal communities. There is increasing speculation that mangrove, a socio-economically important ecosystem, will become more fragile and sensitive to uncertain climate variability such as sea level rise. As a result, mangrove-dependent societies may find themselves trapped in a downward spiral of ecological degradation in terms of their livelihoods and life security. Strengthening the resilience capacity of coastal communities to help them cope with this additional threat from climate change and to ensure sustainability calls for immediate action. In this context, this paper critically examines the regional implications of expected sea level rise and threats to mangrove-dependent communities through a case study approach. The main objective is to highlight the requirement for climate change communication and education to impart information that will fulfil three expectations: (1) confer understanding; (2) assess local inference on climate change through a participatory approach; and (3) construct a framework for climate change awareness among mangrove-dependent communities through community-based non-formal climate change education. This scale of approach is attracting increasing attention from policymakers to achieve climate change adaptation and derive policies from a social perspective.",,,,217.0
273,Reciprocity as deliberative capacity: lessons from a citizen's deliberation on carbon pricing mechanisms in Australia,,2013-01-01,"Australia has seen a deep division in opinion in search of a carbon pricing mechanism. While concepts of carbon taxation and emission trading have comparable public support, climate scepticism is influencing the debates in political and public spheres in downplaying the need for carbon pricing. Public deliberation is a possible engagement option to address the conflict inherent in climate policy preferences. This research explores the way that a deliberative forum involving twenty-four Australians promoted effective communication between participants through which conflict between policy preferences became more tangible. While the forum did not eliminate disagreement in preferences in the choice of carbon pricing mechanisms, participants reached consensus on fundamental principles such as the need for trusted sources of information, trusted governance procedures, and transparent accountability by appropriate institutions. Shared political expectations encouraged dialogue and cooperation in discussions by enhancing reciprocal understanding. Two sceptical participants who originally had strong opinions different from the rest of the group managed to find common ground. Public deliberative forums that are conducive to reciprocal communication are able to provide a mechanism for joint problem-solving processes that are less adversarial and more responsive to the range of people's preferences.",,,,192.0
274,"Integrating Collaboration, Adaptive Management, and Scenario-Planning: Experiences at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area",,2013-01-01,"There is growing recognition that public lands cannot be managed as islands; rather, land management must address the ecological, social, and temporal complexity that often spans jurisdictions and traditional planning horizons. Collaborative decision making and adaptive management (CAM) have been promoted as methods to reconcile competing societal demands and respond to complex ecosystem dynamics. We detail the experiences of land managers and stakeholders in using CAM at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), a highly valued site under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The CAM process at Las Cienegas is marked by strong stakeholder engagement, with four core elements: (1) shared watershed goals with measurable resource objectives; (2) relevant and reliable scientific information; (3) mechanisms to incorporate new information into decision making; and (4) shared learning to improve both the process and management actions. The combination of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management has led to agreement on contentious issues, more innovative solutions, and more effective land management. However, the region is now experiencing rapid changes outside managers' control, including climate change, human population growth, and reduced federal budgets, with large but unpredictable impacts on natural resources. Although the CAM experience provides a strong foundation for making the difficult and contentious management decisions that such changes are likely to require, neither collaboration nor adaptive management provides a sufficient structure for addressing the externalities that drive uncontrollable and unpredictable change. As a result, LCNCA is exploring two specific modifications to CAM that may better address emerging challenges, including: (1) creating nested resource objectives to distinguish between those objectives that may be crucial to maintaining ecological resilience from those that may hinder a flexible response to climate change, and (2) incorporating scenario planning into CAM to explore how climate change may interact with other drivers and alter options for the future, to identify robust management actions, and to prioritize ecological monitoring efforts. The experiences at LCNCA demonstrate how collaboration and adaptive management can be used to improve social and environmental outcomes and, with modifications, may help address the full range of complexity and change that threatens to overwhelm even the best efforts to sustain public lands.",,,,357.0
275,Erosive coping after the 2011 floods in Kenya,,2013-01-01,"Periodic river floods have devastating social and economic impacts on poor households in the low-lying coastal and western regions of Kenya. This paper focuses on how households in Bunyala District coped with the impacts of flooding, and particularly the December 2011 River Nzoia flood. The data for the study was collected through a survey of 400 households, three focus group discussions, four in-depth interviews and six key informant interviews. Of the surveyed household-heads, 393 (98.4%) reported negative impacts of the flood on farming, livestock and/or property. Coping strategies at household level included temporary relocation and migration, reduced expenditure on household needs, engagement in extra income-generating activities, selling of property and reliance on support from public and private agencies. The findings reveal that many of the coping measures that people use are erosive, as they have negative long-term effects on household livelihood sustainability.",,,,142.0
276,Australian residents' attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour and climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef,,2013-01-01,"Climate change and associated environmental impacts are increasingly important issues. Effective communication with residents of coastal communities is critical to mitigate and adapt to changing conditions; however, this can be a challenging feat without an understanding of attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour. Drawing on three dimensions of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, this paper: (1) explores the Australian public's perceptions of climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef; (2) segments respondents into homogenous groups based on their environmental attitudes; and (3) profiles the emergent segments using managerially-relevant indicators. Study findings illustrate that respondents can be organised into five distinct segments according to their attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour that could potentially stem climate change-related impacts. These segments perceive a variety of threats to the health of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, underestimate the performance of behaviours that help to mitigate impacts and face a variety of internal and external constraints on behavioural engagement.",,,,152.0

The prize is synergy: many such policies, for example concerning food, travel and community engagement, can simultaneously improve physical and mental health.",,,,75.0
278,"Engaging the private sector in adaptation to climate change in developing countries: importance, status, and challenges",,2013-01-01,"In developing countries there is a need for the private sector to be more engaged in identifying climate change risks, response measures, and adaptation, and to prioritize these more highly. The importance of the role of the private sector is evident from lessons drawn from the increasing amount of empirical experience on adaptation projects supported by climate funds: successful private sector engagement in adaptation will catalyse greater investment in reducing vulnerability; this in turn will accelerate the replication of climate-resilient technologies and services in core development sectors, especially in developing countries where investment in long-lived infrastructure is growing rapidly. Private sector companies should integrate adaptation into their strategies and investments for their own economic interest, as well as for their clients' interest and for the interests of the countries in which they operate. Unfortunately, private sector efforts on adaptation are not widely understood or seen as good business practice, and generally face several obstacles. Public policy should incentivize such investments by communicating risks, offering incentives for resilience enhancing measures, and where necessary by putting in place regulation to avoid shifting risks onto the public. Stronger public-private partnerships will also help to enhance climate resilience, and at the same time create business opportunities. Private firms will develop many of the products and services that will enable lower cost and more effective responses to climate change, which can be the basis for growing businesses. Ultimately, a paradigm shift is required for business to fully integrate the value associated with managing climate risks.",,,,250.0
279,Reframing Engagement Methods for Climate Change Adaptation,,2013-01-01,"Climate change poses known and unknown risks for coastal communities and also challenges for university faculty and local government staff who communicate about cli- mate sciences. Conceived as a way to move beyond traditional models of science communication, this project involved public and private decision makers in specific at-risk communities in Oregon (U.S. Pacific coast) and Maine (Atlantic coast). Both state projects sought to move behavior toward decisive action that results in coastal communities that are more resilient to climate variability at all scales. To promote engagement between project staffs and publics, a dialogic model of communication was advanced, beginning with interviews and focus groups that in turn shaped further engagement through workshops and targeted video products. This means of communication led to a deeper understanding of participants' knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, values, and barriers to action related to climate change and its effects. Coinciding with this, project participant evaluations in both Oregon and Maine indicate that the workshops and videos were successful at informing them on this complex issue; and in both states, project participation led to action outcomes. We believe that applied elsewhere our multifaceted and adaptive approach will garner similar results, provided sufficient dedicated staffing and attention to methods.",,,,201.0
280,Private sector engagement in climate change adaptation in least developed countries: an exploration,,2013-01-01,"The private sector is increasingly being engaged in climate finance and climate-related activities. Private sector opportunities for engagement in climate change adaptation are less clear than for mitigation, particularly in developing countries. This article first conceptualizes private sector engagement in adaptation by exploring (1) different roles of the private sector in adaptation in developing countries and (2) the way governments can create an enabling environment to increase private sector engagement. Second, it analyses how 47 least developed countries (LDCs) envisage the role of the private sector in their National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). This article argues that private sector engagement in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant. Yet, the results show that it receives little attention in NAPAs. This may have three explanations: (1) an intentional approach of LDCs to avoid a distraction from the necessity to scale up public funding; (2) a lack of awareness of the potential of the private sector; and (3) the NAPA formulation guidelines focus on the public sector in the context of public financing, potentially causing path dependency. Developed countries' historic responsibility for emissions obliges them to upscale public climate finance. At the same time, however, LDCs should further explore private sector engagement in adaptation.",,,,203.0
281,"National-level factors affecting planned, public adaptation to health impacts of climate change",,2013-01-01,"Our understanding of whether adaptive capacity on a national level is being translated into adaptation policies, programs, and projects is limited. Focusing on health adaptation in Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC, we examine whether statistically significant relationships exist between regulatory, institutional, financial, and normative aspects of national-level adaptive capacity and systematically measured adaptation. Specifically, we (i) quantify adaptation actions in Annex I nations, (ii) identify potential factors that might impact progress on adaptation and select measures for these factors, and (iii) calculate statistical relationships between factors and adaptation actions across countries. Statistically significant relationships are found between progress on adaptation and engagement in international environmental governance, national environmental governance, perception of corruption in the public sector, population size, and national wealth, as well as between responsiveness to health vulnerabilities, population size and national wealth. This analysis contributes two key early empirical findings to the growing literature concerning factors facilitating or constraining adaptation. While country size and wealth are necessary for driving higher levels of adaptation, they may be insufficient in the absence of policy commitments to environmental governance. Furthermore, governance and/or incentive frameworks for environmental governance at the national level may be an important indicator of the strength of national commitments to addressing health impacts of climate change.

283,"Lessons from Hurricane Sandy: a Community Response in Brooklyn, New York",,2013-01-01,"The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased in recent decades; one example is Hurricane Sandy. If the frequency and severity continue or increase, adaptation and mitigation efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations and improve daily life under changed weather conditions. This field report examines the devastation due to Hurricane Sandy experienced in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York, a neighborhood consisting of geographically isolated low-lying commercial and residential units, with a concentration of low-income housing, and disproportionate rates of poverty and poor health outcomes largely experienced by Black and Latino residents. Multiple sources of data were reviewed, including street canvasses, governmental reports, community flyers, and meeting transcripts, as well as firsthand observations by a local nonprofit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) and community members, and social media accounts of the effects of Sandy and the response to daily needs. These data are considered within existing theory, evidence, and practice on protecting public health during extreme weather events. Firsthand observations show that a community-based organization in Red Hook, RHI, was at the center of the response to disaster relief, despite the lack of staff training in response to events such as Hurricane Sandy. Review of these data underscores that adaptation and response to climate change and likely resultant extreme weather is a dynamic process requiring an official coordinated governmental response along with on-the-ground volunteer community responders.",,,,227.0
284,Climate Change Adaptive Capacity in Santiago de Chile: Creating a Governance Regime for Sustainability Planning,,2013-01-01,"For most urban areas, the challenges of adaptation are as urgent as those of mitigation. This is particularly the case where adaptive capacity is weak, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and the benefits of global mitigation in the short term will be experienced beyond 2050. A focus on adaptive capacity-building in these vulnerable settings is imperative. Much of the emphasis in climate change since the early 1990s has been on basic science and how public policy should respond to it; less attention has been paid to the governance implications and connections with wider development processes. This article explores the governance challenges of adaptation in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. It points to weaknesses in the water and energy sectors, which have highly sectoral, horizontally unintegrated institutional structures and instruments that pose significant challenges for adaptation. Such cases point to the need to engage with both the wider planning concerns of existing development strategies and the basic elements of transdisciplinarity, finance and human capital-building, in order to forge a more integrated adaptation response. Without an engagement with the governance issue and wider debates around metropolitan planning and socioeconomic development, it is unlikely the response will move beyond a limited physical infrastructure investment programme.",,,,202.0
285,Who teaches and who learns? Policy learning through the C40 cities climate network,,2012-01-01,"This study examines the network structure of policy learning in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which is a network of the world's largest cities committed to tackling climate change issues. Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning.",,,,207.0

The perspectives of energy systems and climate change play an important role in the development and implementation of emerging energy technologies and attendant policies on greenhouse gas reduction. This research examines citizens' views on climate change and a number of energy systems, with a specific focus on the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a technology to address greenhouse gas emissions. An all-day workshop with 82 local participants was held in the city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada to explore the views of climate change, energy and CCS: Participants were provided the opportunity to ask experts questions and discuss in small groups their views of climate change policy and energy systems. Results demonstrate that participants' assessments of energy systems are influenced by social-political-institutional-economic contexts such as trust in industry and government, perception of parties benefiting from the technology, and tradeoffs between energy systems. We discuss our findings in the context of understanding social learning processes as part of socio-technical systems change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,206.0

Action across so many functions necessarily involves a range of organisations that may have differing priorities and motivations. This paper presents the concept of a decision theatre and describes how this approach was tested by co-designing, with a range of stakeholders, two events to identify the current vulnerabilities of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne to a storm event and to investigate the effectiveness of adaptation options to surface water flooding. The collaborative environment improved understanding of the physical and social vulnerabilities in the city, defined research questions relevant to society, improved the consideration of policy suggestions grounded in reality and improved the joint ownership of the issues and the facility itself. The lessons learned helped develop a long-term vision for a more widely applicable research and engagement facility for exploring and understanding decision-making with a range of stakeholders, including the general public.",,,,164.0
288,Learning with practitioners: climate change adaptation priorities in a Canadian community,,2013-01-01,"Adaptation is already a necessary response to climate change for northern communities. The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes. Lessons from the Prince George experience can be applied to other communities as they strive to effectively adapt to climate change.",,,,240.0
289,"Combining qualitative and quantitative understanding for exploring cross-sectoral climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability in Europe",,2013-01-01,"Climate change will affect all sectors of society and the environment at all scales, ranging from the continental to the national and local. Decision-makers and other interested citizens need to be able to access reliable science-based information to help them respond to the risks of climate change impacts and assess opportunities for adaptation. Participatory integrated assessment (IA) tools combine knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines, take account of the value and importance of stakeholder 'lay insight' and facilitate a two-way iterative process of exploration of 'what if's' to enable decision-makers to test ideas and improve their understanding of the complex issues surrounding adaptation to climate change. This paper describes the conceptual design of a participatory IA tool, the CLIMSAVE IA Platform, based on a professionally facilitated stakeholder engagement process. The CLIMSAVE (climate change integrated methodology for cross-sectoral adaptation and vulnerability in Europe) Platform is a user-friendly, interactive web-based tool that allows stakeholders to assess climate change impacts and vulnerabilities for a range of sectors, including agriculture, forests, biodiversity, coasts, water resources and urban development. The linking of models for the different sectors enables stakeholders to see how their interactions could affect European landscape change. The relationship between choice, uncertainty and constraints is a key cross-cutting theme in the conduct of past participatory IA. Integrating scenario development processes with an interactive modelling platform is shown to allow the exploration of future uncertainty as a structural feature of such complex problems, encouraging stakeholders to explore adaptation choices within real-world constraints of future resource availability and environmental and institutional capacities, rather than seeking the 'right' answers.",,,,262.0
290,Participatory scenario development for environmental management: A methodological framework illustrated with experience from the UK uplands,,2013-01-01,"A methodological framework is proposed for participatory scenario development on the basis of evidence from the literature, and is tested and refined through the development of scenarios for the future of UK uplands. The paper uses a review of previous work to justify a framework based around the following steps: i) define context and establish whether there is a basis for stakeholder engagement in scenario development; ii) systematically identify and represent relevant stakeholders in the process; iii) define clear objectives for scenario development with stakeholders including spatial and temporal boundaries; iv) select relevant participatory methods for scenario development, during initial scenario construction, evaluation and to support decision-making based on scenarios; and v) integrate local and scientific knowledge throughout the process. The application of this framework in case study research suggests that participatory scenario development has the potential to: i) make scenarios more relevant to stakeholder needs and priorities; ii) extend the range of scenarios developed; iii) develop more detailed and precise scenarios through the integration of local and scientific knowledge; and iv) move beyond scenario development to facilitate adaptation to future change. It is argued that participatory scenario development can empower stakeholders and lead to more consistent and robust scenarios that can help people prepare more effectively for future change.

291,Strategic Bundling of Development Policies with Adaptation: An Examination of Delhi's Climate Change Action Plan,,2013-01-01,"A growing number of cities in the global South are taking proactive action on climate change. Their plans provide insights into the potential for strategically bundling long-term development policymaking with the climate agenda. In this article I study the case of Delhi, the first city in India to adopt a climate change action plan. Drawing on the literature on urban ecological security, I examine: (1) the adaptation challenges that Delhi faces; (2) the multiple motivations that underlie early action; (3) the key actors, strategies, and associated action domains outlined in the plan; and (4) the extent to which the plan seeks to bring about systemic change. Proactive action at the city level serves multiple strategic goals. Delhi's case is significant in illustrating how it has leveraged emergent opportunities to advance its short-term development agenda, given the tight fiscal constraints and governance challenges it faces. The plan has been strategically formulated to enhance competiveness, facilitate image-building, garner support for pet projects and access alternative sources of funding. But the short-term orientation of the plan and its limited mechanisms for citizen engagement have severely restrained its capacity to address underlying social vulnerabilities or bring about transformative change.",,,,195.0

We propose an alternative incrementalist approach that focuses on managing uncertainties rather than reducing them and building resilience not simply through the reduction of hazard exposure, but also through the ongoing reduction of community vulnerability, the explicit consideration of normative priorities, and more effective community engagement in climate risk debates.

293,Planning for Climate Change: Is Greater Public Participation the Key to Success?,,2013-01-01,"Within most democracies there is an assumption that greater public participation and engagement in policy processes results in more effective policy measures. These assumed benefits include better framed and more robust policies and a more informed, articulate and engaged citizenry. Similar assumptions exist also in planning for climate adaptation where more public participation and engagement are seen as vital components of any adaptation strategy and policy development process. This article explores these assumptions and considers whether there is any evidence that the success of planning for unavoidable climate change is related to the extent of public participation. Using an evaluation framework based on three aspects of participation we critically review a set of climate adaptation policy instruments developed within each of the three levels of government in Australia but with a specific focus on the region of South East Queensland.",,,,140.0

296,"Psychological care of caregivers, nurses and physicians: a study of a new approach",,2014-01-01,"There is much evidence demonstrating that psychosocial interventions in caregivers and oncological staff produce an improvement in their patients' quality of life. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate the effect of a new approach in promoting more functional ways to face stressful situations in the constellation of people around patients: caregivers, physicians and nurses. Thirty-four subjects were divided into three groups: 10 care-givers, 11 physicians, and 13 nurses. A ""Balint Group"" method modified according to a mind-fulness technique was used as the intervention. Three assessment tools were administered to the participants at baseline, during, and after completion of the study: the Response Evaluation Measure (REM-71), the Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P), and the Group Climate Questionnaire (GCQ). Mean values of defense mechanisms determined by the REM-71 were compared with those of the standard population. At baseline, we observed a prevalence of immature defenses in the three groups, with mean values above those in the standard population. After the psychological intervention, a tendency to normalization of the mean values was observed, indicating the development of more adaptive ways of using defense mechanisms and the effectiveness of the intervention. Group climate, assessed through the GCQ, showed an increase in the ""Engagement"" factor and a decline in the ""Conflict"" factor in all groups. This study suggests that group treatment focused on changing personal responses to stressful situations can induce more adaptive strategies enabling caregivers, hematologists, and nurses to help patients better and thereby improve their quality of life.",,,,246.0
297,Adapting to climate change through urban water management: a participatory case study in Indonesia,,2014-01-01,"The benefits of integrated approaches to climate risk and adaptation studies are increasingly recognised. Thus, there is an increasing need for practical examples of such work in the literature. This paper describes a practical application of an integrated framework for climate change impacts on regional surface water resources and the urban water system in the Mamminasata metropolitan region, Indonesia. Two main features of the framework are: the integration of both climate and other physical and social considerations in the assessment; and the high stakeholder involvement before, during and after project implementation. Although the study is concerned with the Mamminasata region, the overall methodology is transferable to any region in Indonesia or internationally. Key outcomes from this study are: (1) creation of information for Mamminasata planners and water resources managers for when, and under what conditions, the water supply may or may not meet the demand; (2) a clear consensus and shared learning of the problems facing the region among cross-institutional stakeholders; and (3) identification of adaptation options for the urban water system and knowledge gaps and strategies for their implementation. Results of stakeholders' surveys conducted at the mid-point and at the end of the study indicate that these outputs will provide valuable guidance for future planning and management of Mamminasata regional water resources.",,,,213.0
298,Climate change research and policy in Portugal,,2014-01-01,"This article offers a review of research and policy on climate change in Portugal and is organized into three main themes: scientific knowledge and assessment of climate change; policy analysis and evaluation; and public engagement. Modern scientific research on meteorology and climatology started in Portugal in the 1950s and a strong community of researchers in climate science, vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptation has since developed, particularly in the last decade. Nevertheless, there are still many gaps in research, especially regarding the economic costs of climate change in Portugal and costs and benefits of adaptation. Governmental policies with a strong emphasis on mitigation were introduced at the end of the 1990s. As greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise beyond its Kyoto target for 2012, the country had to resort to the Kyoto Flexibility Mechanisms in order to comply. Climate change adaptation policies were introduced in 2010 but are far from being fully implemented. Regarding public engagement with climate change, high levels of concern contrast with limited understanding and rather weak behavioral dispositions to address climate change. Citizens display a heavy reliance on the media as sources of information, which are dominated by a techno-managerial discourse mainly focused on the global level. The final part of the article identifies research gaps and outlines a research agenda. Connections between policy and research are also discussed.

Thus, understanding private forest owners and managers, and their attitudes to uncertainty and change, is essential for the success of climate change adaptation policies. The aims of this study are to (1) assess how beliefs in climate change in the private sector have influenced forest management practices; (2) identify constraints related to changes in species choice and silvicultural systems; (3) analyse the implications for implementing climate change policy in forestry. Semi-structured interviews with key informants who provide advice to, or manage woodlands in, the private forest sector in north Wales. Woodland managers and some advisers are not generally convinced of a need to adapt. They feel the future is uncertain, more usually in relation to tree disease than to climate change itself. Species choice is the principle focus of adaptation activities and reveals a deep divide in opinion. Commercial advisors look to new exotics but are inhibited by absence of markets, while small-scale owners rely more on native genetic diversity. Findings that are likely to apply widely include: the influential role of forest agents in forest management decisions including species choice; lack of confidence in climate change predictions, and in markets; more immediate concerns about tree pests and diseases; demand for leadership from the public sector, and for engagement amongst the private sector. Further research is needed across a wider area to test the variability in relationship between attitudes and behaviours, and local conditions including climate change predictions.",,,,246.0

It explores the language used to discuss adaptation, what is known about resonant frames, drawing on adaptation discourses in policy, practice, and the media. Identifying trends and widely applicable insights is made challenging not only by the variety of words used to speak of adaptation, but by the fact that adaptation' language is often not used at all. A broad literature on perceptions and experiences of climate change impacts and how these experiences affect people's valuations and emotional responses to climate change offers crucial insights to the challenges and opportunities in communicating adaptation. It reveals much about people's interest in and acceptability and knowledge of adaptation, about preferred timing and who is thought to be responsible for enacting adaptive actions. Insights from the literature on place attachment and place identity are of particular relevance to public engagement on adaptation as it goes a long way toward explaining the quality of the adaptation debate to date while offering promising opportunities for dialogue. Suggestions for improved adaptation communication practice and critical research gaps are offered. For further resources related to this article, please visit the .

Where complex science and technology issues are involved in policy making, this takes time, so it is important to identify emerging issues of this type and prepare engagement plans. In our horizon scanning exercise, we used a modified Delphi technique [1]. A wide group of people with interests in the science and policy interface (drawn from policy makers, policy adviser, practitioners, the private sector and academics) elicited a long list of emergent policy issues in which science and technology would feature strongly and which would also necessitate public engagement as policies are developed. This was then refined to a short list of top priorities for policy makers. Thirty issues were identified within broad areas of business and technology; energy and environment; government, politics and education; health, healthcare, population and aging; information, communication, infrastructure and transport; and public safety and national security.",,,,169.0

The country has examined their vulnerabilities to climate change and many public health impacts have been projected. A variety of qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used in the assessment: literature reviews, interviews, focus groups, time series and regression analysis, damage and adaptation cost estimation, and scenario-based assessment. Policies and interventions to minimize the risks and development of long-term adaptation strategies have been explored. The generation of a robust evidence base and the development of stakeholder engagement have been used to support the development of an adaptation strategy and to promote adaptive capacity by improving the resilience of public health systems to climate change. Climate change adaptation has been established as a priority within existing national policy instruments. The lessons learnt from the process are applicable to countries considering how best to improve adaptive capacity and resilience of health systems to climate variability and its associated impacts.",,,,187.0
303,Narrative research in climate change adaptation-Exploring a complementary paradigm for research and governance,,2014-01-01,"Climate adaptation research increasingly focuses on the socio-cultural dimensions of change. In this context, narrative research is often seen as a qualitative social science method used to frame adaptation communication. However, this perspective neglects an important insight provided by narrative theory as applied in the cognitive sciences and other practical fields: human cognition is organized around specific narrative structures. In adaptation, this means that how we 'story' the environment determines how we understand and practice adaptation, how risks are defined, who is authorized as actors in the change debate, and the range of policy options considered. Furthermore, relating an experience through story-telling is already doing 'knowledge work', or learning. In taking narrative beyond its use as an extractive social research methodology, we argue that narrative research offers an innovative, holistic approach to a better understanding of socio-ecological systems and the improved, participatory design of local adaptation policies. Beyond producing data on local knowledge(s) and socio-cultural and affective-emotive factors influencing adaptive capacity, it can significantly inform public engagement, deliberation and learning strategies-features of systemic adaptive governance. We critically discuss narrative as both a self-reflective methodology and as a paradigmatic shift in future adaptation research and practice. We explore the narrative approach as a basis for participatory learning in the governance of socio-ecological systems. Finally, we assemble arguments for investing in alternative governance approaches consistent with a shift to a 'narrative paradigm'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,237.0
304,Women and water management in times of climate change: participatory and inclusive processes,,2013-01-01,"This paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

306,"Priming the Governance System for Climate Change Adaptation: The Application of a Social-Ecological Inventory to Engage Actors in Niagara, Canada",,2014-01-01,"Climate change adaptation presents a challenge to current top-down governance structures, including the tension between provision of public goods and actions required by diverse stakeholders, including private actors. Alternative governance approaches that facilitate participation and learning across scales are gaining attention for their ability to bring together diverse actors across sectors and to foster adaptive capacity and resilience. We have described the method and outcomes from the application of a social-ecological inventory to ""prime,"" i.e., hasten the development of, a regional climate change adaptation network. The social-ecological inventory tool draws on the social-ecological systems approach in which social and ecological systems are considered linked. The tool bridges the gap between conventional stakeholder analysis and biological inventories, drawing on a social-ecological systems approach, and incorporates local knowledge as an explicit component. The process, which is dynamic and iterative, includes six phases: preparations, preliminary identification, identification of key individuals, interviewing, reviewing and enriching the inventory, and engagement. By considering the social and ecological aspects of a system, a more comprehensive inventory is achieved that provides a foundational platform to facilitate or support climate change adaptation processes that are participatory and learning oriented. Although social-ecological inventories have been used for ecosystem management, the intent of this research was to understand the potential of the tool for climate change adaptation. A social-ecological inventory was undertaken in the Niagara Region of Canada to assemble and facilitate a regional governance group to champion climate change adaptation. Moreover, the social-ecological inventory was purposefully undertaken as the initial step in priming the governance system and led into an adaptive comanagement process for climate change adaptation. Early indicators suggest that the social-ecological inventory has been instrumental in facilitating a multisectoral adaptive comanagement governance approach to climate change in the Niagara Region.",,,,292.0

308,Using social representations theory to make sense of climate change: what scientists and nonscientists in Australia think,,2014-01-01,"The mass media has ensured that the challenging and complex phenomenon of climate change now has the household familiarity of a brand name. But what is it that is understood by climate change, and by whom? What frame of reference is drawn upon to communicate meaningfully about climate change? Do particular subgroups within our society hold different understandings, or have the debate and the prolific dissemination of information about this issue coalesced around a core perception or image of what climate change is? To answer these questions, we conceptualized climate change within the theory of social representations as emergent socially constructed knowledge. We analyzed word association data collected in Australia from persons identifying as having a scientific, government, or general public background (N = 3300). All respondents were asked to write the first words that came to mind when they thought about climate change. Comparative analyses of the word associations reveal that respondents from different backgrounds define climate change in different ways. The results suggest that there is a common core set of concepts shared by the different groups, but there are also a great many differences in how climate change is framed and conceived by respondents. The results are discussed in relation to what they imply for responses to climate change by these social groups and in relation to interventions designed to encourage climate adaptation.",,,,226.0
309,Meeting institutional criteria for social resilience: a nested risk system model,,2014-01-01,"Communities of Alaska's North Slope face increased stresses from cumulative effects of industrial development, resource use, and changing cryospheric and socioeconomic conditions. Given these multiple pressures, what avenues exist for citizens and decision makers to exchange knowledge about impacts of oil resource extraction in Alaska, and how do the successes and failures of knowledge exchange affect the resilience of the local social ecological system? We focused our research on the risk management process of Alaska North Slope oil resources, drawing on literature that has grown out of the risk society thesis and concepts of resilience science. We surveyed state and federal initiatives designed to increase local and indigenous stakeholder engagement in science and policy issues because such guidelines and regulations impact on the abilities of local peoples and communities to adapt sustainability strategies. Perceived risks and desired outcomes of stakeholders on the front lines of climate change and resource development should inform regulations that aim to anticipate future impacts and needed adaptation strategies. Integration of local values and perceptions in an adaptive risk management approach is fundamental in resilience-based ecosystem stewardship. The three case studies we have presented show that current provisions fail to equitably include the local and indigenous knowledge of Alaska's North Slope Borough communities in environmental risk mediation in proportion to the scope of risks inherent in current oil development policies. Our findings underscore the need for new, proactive risk management strategies that build on local stakeholders' rationalities on the trade-offs of risks and opportunities.",,,,248.0
310,Perceived Effects of Organizational Downsizing and Staff Cuts on the Stress Experience: The Role of Resources,,2014-01-01,"In response to global financial pressures, retail companies have introduced measures to reduce costs by cutting staff allocations to individual outlets. On the basis of interview data from four employees of a large retail organization, this paper employs an ideographic case-study approach to illustrate how the processes linking job characteristics to job-related strain and well-being (e.g. appraisal, action regulation, coping, resource utilization) unfold within four individual workers, as they attempt to manage perceived increases in demands resulting from staff cuts. We highlight the importance that these employees place on their own psychological resources (e.g. self-efficacy) and coping mechanisms (e.g. disengagement) in dealing with these changes, as well as how the perceived availability or absence of job resources (e.g. social support, decision authority, organizational justice) influences their ability to cope with increased demands. We use the insights gained from the case studies to illustrate the value of integrating multiple theoretical perspectives towards achieving a nuanced understanding of the intricacies involved in these experiences and to suggest ways in which the coping capacities of individual employees might be increased.

311,"Climate Change, Urban Development, and Storm Water: Perspectives from the Field",,2014-01-01,"Climate projections in many U.S. metropolitan areas show increases in daily temperature, and potential shifts in rainfall patterns toward stronger, more intense storms. At the same time, metropolitan regions continuing to experience population growth face the prospect of areal expansion and higher land-use intensities. The possible coupling of such developmental changes and more frequent intense precipitation events poses a litany of well-known challenges to storm-water management. This paper reports survey research that examines the experiences and expectations of engineers, planners, and other agency staff in storm-water management in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan region in the context of climate change. We find that staff from jurisdictions with a high degree of development and strong population growth, and those with more work experience, engagement with climate issues in their work, and greater belief that scientists understand climate change, exhibit a higher level of concern with the potential threat of climate change on storm water runoff.",,,,152.0

313,"Assessing the vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to sea level rise using multi-criteria analysis in Scarborough, Maine (USA)",,2014-01-01,"Sea level rise and climate change will have widespread impacts on coastal towns and cities, many of which have seen dramatic increases in development over recent decades. In addition to potential private property damage, the critical public infrastructure that supports these regions will become increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding. This paper describes a straightforward, structured methodology for identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities in the coastal community of Scarborough, Maine, USA. The study uses GIS mapping and analysis techniques to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities in a coastal town under three different potential future flooding scenarios. A simple multi-criteria analysis matrix is used to explore the often hard to quantify, multifaceted consequences of infrastructure loss. Numerical scores are attributed to represent the economic, social, health and safety and environmental impacts of coastal flooding, allowing vulnerable locations to be ranked in order of overall importance. The results are summarized in a series of tables, maps and data sheets that convey data in readily accessible formats. High traffic roads, including evacuation routes, and major utility corridors are identified as the most critical vulnerable infrastructure assets in the town. Targeted improvements are recommended in these critical areas to improve system and community resilience to climate change and sea level rise. Our approach makes use of standard techniques, requires limited data and is therefore readily transferable for use in infrastructure planning in other similar communities. The methodology encourages public engagement and education, and the results can be used by the local authorities to pursue external funding opportunities to support investment in proactive infrastructure adaptation. The identification of key system weaknesses will allow future infrastructure investment to be targeted to the most critical areas, and assist in improving emergency response plans.

314,Encountering climate change: 'seeing' is more than 'believing',,2014-01-01,"Individuals' direct exposure to and experience of climate change are arguably integral aspects of their risk perceptions, understandings, and engagement with the issue. Recent research investigating these experiences has thrown into sharp relief some fundamental considerations with respect to public risk perceptions and responses, in particular the extent to which such perceived encounters might reflect a priori beliefs and motivated reasoning. Findings to date are intriguing and compelling, both in regard to the escalating percentages of individuals who report having such personal encounters, and conclusions being drawn with respect to the nature, significance, and influence of such direct experience. These findings have also led to some intuitively reasonable but possibly problematic recommendations regarding policy and issue and behavioural engagement implications. A focus on underlying processes of experience and belief, oversimplified in terms of 'seeing' or 'believing', has however deflected attention from other issues such as the nature and contexts of individual climate change encounters, the clarity of the constructs and validity of the measures being used for 'belief' and 'experience', and the transactional and phenomenological nature of climate change encounters. There is nonetheless current and convergent evidence that perceived direct experience of environmental changes or events deemed to be manifestations of climate change influences psychological responses such as risk perception, acceptance, belief certainty, distress, and psychological and behavioural adaptation. These findings suggest that such experiences, for many, foster a contextualized and more personally meaningful realisation of what climate change portends, implies, and ultimately means, locally and globally.

315,Proximity to Coast Is Linked to Climate Change Belief,,2014-01-01,"Psychologists have examined the many psychological barriers to both climate change belief and concern. One barrier is the belief that climate change is too uncertain, and likely to happen in distant places and times, to people unlike oneself. Related to this perceived psychological distance of climate change, studies have shown that direct experience of the effects of climate change increases climate change concern. The present study examined the relationship between physical proximity to the coastline and climate change belief, as proximity may be related to experiencing or anticipating the effects of climate change such as sea-level rise. We show, in a national probability sample of 5,815 New Zealanders, that people living in closer proximity to the shoreline expressed greater belief that climate change is real and greater support for government regulation of carbon emissions. This proximity effect held when adjusting for height above sea level and regional poverty. The model also included individual differences in respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth. The results indicate that physical place plays a role in the psychological acceptance of climate change, perhaps because the effects of climate change become more concrete and local.",,,,191.0
316,Motivating mitigation: when health matters more than climate change,,2014-01-01,"The US public consistently ranks climate change as a low national priority due, in part, to a lack of personal engagement and a sense of temporal and spatial distance from the environmental effects (Leiserowitz 2006). Yet, the chief method for climate change mitigation, the reduction of fossil fuel use, would also reduce particulate air pollution, which is implicated in over three million deaths worldwide each year (Lim et al. 2013). Indeed, in the US, improved public health ranks among the top perceived benefits of reducing fossil fuel use (Leiserowitz et al. 2013), and the scientific community has been promoting these benefits-such as reduction in hospitalizations and premature deaths -for over a decade (Cifuentes et al. 2001; West et al. 2013). Furthermore, the health behavior literature demonstrates that personal perception of risk, which is likely to be linked to health, is one of the strongest motivators of behavioral change (Few 2007; Maibach and Parrott 1995). Thus, one possible method for garnering support for carbon emissions reduction is to emphasize the added co-benefit of reducing present-day, health-related impacts. However, it remains to be understood whether public health messaging can lead to improved climate change mitigation efforts, or how specific segments of the US population will respond to this message. In particular, emphasizing health co-benefits may be a strong motivator of attitude change among individuals who are less concerned about environmental threats or who deny the existence of anthropogenic climate change.",,,,238.0
317,Reframing the Climate Change Debate to Better Leverage Policy Change: An Analysis of Public Opinion and Political Psychology,,2014-01-01,"U.S. climate change-related policy response is failing, despite scientific consensus on core realities, in part because of comprehensive, simultaneous, yet incommensurable doctrines and political biases. Climate disruption is a critically important agenda for homeland security and emergency management, yet as framed today, the policy communication regime frequently requires many skeptics or deniers to abandon their opinions, cultural commitments and epistemic frameworks. Public opinion consensus would be optimal, but the traditional education/information approach is flawed, and continued delays in significant mitigation and adaptation policy implementation will mean far larger future costs to protect civilian environmental security and national interests. Thus, effective response demands new messaging strategies, pursuing interim progress, leveraging overlapping consensus, enhancing risk analysis literacy, and constructing alternative, intermediary categories of multiple parallel discourse. These framings would center on security, economic interests, public health, religious stewardship, and other themes. Customized audience discourses may enable better public and opinion leader buy-in, partly transcending polarization, since such leaders have a unique ability to help translate and promote these various discourses. In addition, eventual construction of a multi-dimensional map could optimize effective messaging and supportive coalitions. Otherwise, stalemate on climate-related policy and environmental security will continue, with increasingly likely catastrophic implications.",,,,198.0
318,"Perception, attitude and behavior in relation to climate change: A survey among CDC health professionals in Shanxi province, China",,2014-01-01,"Background: A better understanding of public perceptions, attitude and behavior in relation to climate change will provide an important foundation for government's policy-making, service provider's guideline development and the engagement of local communities. The purpose of this study was to assess the perception towards climate change, behavior change, mitigation and adaptation measures issued by the central government among the health professionals in the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in China. Methods: In 2013, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken among 314 CDC health professionals in various levels of CDC in Shanxi Province, China. Descriptive analyses were performed. Results: More than two thirds of the respondents believed that climate change has happened at both global and local levels, and climate change would lead to adverse impacts to human beings. Most respondents (74.8%) indicated the emission of greenhouse gases was the cause of climate change, however there was a lack of knowledge about greenhouse gases and their sources. Media was the main source from which respondents obtained the information about climate change. A majority of respondents showed that they were willing to change behavior, but their actions were limited. In terms of mitigation and adaptation measures issued by the Chinese Government, respondents' perception showed inconsistency between strategies and relevant actions. Moreover, although the majority of respondents believed some strategies and measures were extremely important to address climate change, they were still concerned about economic development, energy security, and local environmental protection. Conclusion: There are gaps between perceptions and actions towards climate change among these health professionals. Further efforts need to be made to raise the awareness of climate change among health professionals, and to promote relevant actions to address climate change in the context of the proposed policies with local sustainable development.

319,Understanding Corn Belt farmer perspectives on climate change to inform engagement strategies for adaptation and mitigation,,2014-01-01,"Development of extension and outreach that effectively engage farmers in climate change adaptation and/or mitigation activities can be informed by an improved understanding of farmers' perspectives on climate change and related impacts. This research employed latent class analysis (LCA) to analyze data from a survey of 4,778 farmers from 11 US Corn Belt states. The research focused on two related research questions: (1) to what degree do farmers differ on key measures of beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks to agriculture, efficacy, and level of support for public and private adaptive and mitigative action; and (2) are there potential areas of common ground among farmers? Results indicate that farmers have highly heterogeneous perspectives, and six distinct classes of farmers are identified. We label these as the following: the concerned (14%), the uneasy (25%), the uncertain (25%), the unconcerned (13%), the confident (18%), and the detached (5%). These groups of farmers differ primarily in terms of beliefs about climate change, the degree to which they had experienced extreme weather, and risk perceptions. Despite substantial differences on these variables, areas of similarity were discerned on variables measuring farmers' (1) confidence that they will be able to deal with increases in weather variability and (2) support for public and private efforts to help farmers adapt to increased weather variability. These results can inform segmented approaches to outreach that target subpopulations of farmers as well as broader engagement strategies that would reach wider populations. Further, findings suggest that strategies with specific reference to climate change might be most effective in engaging the subpopulations of farmers who believe that climate change is occurring and a threat, but that use of less charged terms such as weather variability would likely be more effective with a broader range of farmers. Outreach efforts that (1) appeal to farmers' problem solving capacity and (2) employ terms such as ""weather variability"" instead of more charged terms such as ""climate change"" are more likely to be effective with a wider farmer audience.",,,,335.0
320,"Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses",,2014-01-01,"Climate change impacts on marine environments have been somewhat neglected in climate change research, particularly with regard to their social dimensions and implications. This paper contributes to addressing this gap through presenting a UK focused mixed-method study of how publics frame, understand and respond to marine climate change-related issues. It draws on data from a large national survey of UK publics (N = 1,001), undertaken in January 2011 as part of a wider European survey, in conjunction with in-depth qualitative insights from a citizens' panel with participants from the East Anglia region, UK. This reveals that discrete marine climate change impacts, as often framed in technical or institutional terms, were not the most immediate or significant issues for most respondents. Study participants tended to view these climate impacts 'in context', in situated ways, and as entangled with other issues relating to marine environments and their everyday lives. Whilst making connections with scientific knowledge on the subject, public understandings of marine climate impacts were mainly shaped by personal experience, the visibility and proximity of impacts, sense of personal risk and moral or equity-based arguments. In terms of responses, study participants prioritised climate change mitigation measures over adaptation, even in high-risk areas. We consider the implications of these insights for research and practices of public engagement on marine climate impacts specifically, and climate change more generally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

321,How are householders talking about climate change adaptation?,,2014-01-01,"Given the wealth of information and research on the roles and responsibilities of the general public in climate mitigation, the lack of engagement of householders on climate adaptation is notable by its absence. As climate change impacts vary with locality, local adaption is important; however there are few processes that build awareness and engagement of householders with climate adaptation and planning. Using reports of discussions from 96 groups convened as part of a climate change engagement program called Energymark; this paper explores the concerns of householders around climate change and provides a lay perspective on climate adaptation. Analyses of group discussions reveal that householders were unable to readily distinguish between climate adaptation and mitigation actions. Groups discussed how they could increase local adaptive capacity through active citizenship and community action. This applied research provides empirical evidence of how deliberation can build social capital and contribute to local adaptive solutions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,156.0
322,Making it personal: Diversity and deliberation in climate adaptation planning,,2015-01-01,"The vulnerabilities and health burdens of climate change fall disproportionately upon lower income communities and communities of color. Yet the very groups who are most affected by climate change impacts are least likely to be involved in climate adaptation discussions. These communities face critical barriers to involvement including historical disenfranchisement, as well as a sense that climate change is distant and not personally relevant. Boundary organizations are increasingly playing an important role in bringing science to bear on policy decision-making with respect to climate change adaptation, an issue fraught with political and ideological tensions. Our project aimed to engage underrepresented communities in climate change adaptation decision-making using a neighborhood consensus conference model developed and tested in several diverse districts of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Our partnership, a ""linked chain'' of boundary organizations, devised a neighborhood consensus conference model to present best-available climate data as tangible, place-based scenarios. In so doing, we made climate change ""personal'' for those who remain outside of climate change planning discourses and opened an opportunity for them to assess their community's vulnerabilities and communicate their priorities for public investment. Our neighborhood-based model built trust and social capital with local residents and allowed us to bring new voices into conversations around climate change adaptation concerns and priorities. We believe this work will have a long term impact on local climate adaptation planning decisions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

323,Dealing with changing risks: a New Zealand perspective on climate change adaptation,,2015-01-01,"Future changes in New Zealand's climate are expected to be less than in many other countries, and New Zealand has well-established governance structures for dealing with environmental risks. While this might imply that adaptation would be straightforward, extensive public and private investments, as well as many traditional MAori assets and cultural values, are in areas increasingly at risk of flooding and sea level rise. In order to consider the country's adaptive capacity in more detail, we have used an empirical research approach, working with government practitioners at three levels and with MAori communities. Very different perceptions of risk, and structural inertia in planning processes have emerged as key issues for implementing adaptation responses. In particular, the use of static frameworks biases responses towards retrospective, rather than anticipatory analysis. Ongoing socioeconomic changes in New Zealand also raise the risk of structural effects caused by climate change impacts becoming unevenly distributed across society. Our analysis indicates that a national and regional strategic approach, centred on a dynamic view of climate risk, is necessary for effective decisions at the local government and community level. In addition, effective adaptation requires better identification of barriers and opportunities for addressing changing risk, together with more effective and continuous social engagement.",,,,204.0
324,A framework for examining adaptation readiness,,2015-01-01,"Adaptation readiness is proposed as a complimentary concept to adaptive capacity that captures the strength and existence of governance structures and policy processes which determine whether adaptation takes place. As such, adaptation readiness is concerned with examining actual experiences with planning for adaptation and seeks to characterize whether human systems are prepared and ready to 'do adaptation.' We propose a framework for evaluating readiness, identifying 6 overarching factors essential for adaptation taking place: political leadership, institutional organization, adaptation decision making and stakeholder engagement, availability of usable science, funding for adaptation, and public support for adaptation. For each readiness factor we identify potential indicators, data sources, and considerations for analysis, outlining approaches for quantitative scoring and qualitative examination. We briefly illustrate application of the framework using an example from the territory of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic, a region projected to experience some of the most dramatic changes in climate globally this century. The framework provides a systematic approach for assessing adaptation readiness, and can be used - in combination with other approaches - to inform the identification and prioritization of adaptation support, guide resources to areas where need is greatest, and serve as a proxy for adaptation tracking.",,,,198.0
325,Monitored versus experience-based perceptions of environmental change: evidence from coastal Tanzania,,2015-01-01,"The impacts of climate change are likely to exacerbate many problems that coastal areas already face. In this study, we used multinomial logistic regression to examine human perception of climate change based on a cross-sectional survey of 1253 individuals in coastal regions of Tanzania. This was complemented with time series analysis of 50-year meteorological data. The results indicate that self-rated ability to handle work pressure, self-rated ability to handle personal pressure and unexpected difficulties, age, region and educational status were significant predictors of perceived temperature change unlike ethnicity and gender. A disproportionately large percentage of respondents of all ages indicated that temperature was getting hotter between the past 10 and 30 years. This observation was supported by the time series analysis. Although respondents also alluded to changes in rainfall patterns in the past 10-30 years, time series analysis of rainfall revealed a different scenario except for Mtwara region of Tanzania. Because there is agreement between respondents' perceptions of temperature and available scientific climatic evidence over the 50-year period, this study argues that when meteorological records are incomplete or unavailable, local perceptions of climatic changes can be used to complement scientific climatic evidence. Based on the spatial differentials in climate change perception observed in this study, there is opportunity for a more locally oriented adaptation dimension to climate policy integration, which has hitherto been underserved by both academics and policymakers.",,,,229.0
326,Beyond 'deniers' and 'believers': Towards a map of the politics of climate change,,2015-01-01,"The politics of climate change is not concerned solely with rival scientific claims about global warming but also with how best to govern the climate. Despite this, categories in climate politics remain caught up in the concepts of the 'science wars', rarely progressing far beyond the denier/believer-dichotomy. This article aims to nudge climate politics beyond the polarized scientific debates while also counteracting the de-politicisation that comes from assuming scientific claims lead directly to certain policies. First existing typologies of climate political positions are reviewed. Diverse contributions make up an emerging field of 'climate politology' but these tend to reduce climate politics either to views on the science or to products of cultural world-views. Drawing on policy analysis literature, a new approach is outlined, where problem-definitions and solution-framings provide the coordinates for a two-dimensional grid. The degree to which climate change is considered a 'wicked' problem on the one hand, and individualist or collectivist ways of understanding political agency on the other, provide a map of climate political positions beyond 'believers' vs 'deniers'.

This is essential if an informed society is to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Women, due to the type of activities they perform in the household, may have a prominent and leading role in this sphere and thus constitute a group holding great potential to support policies to deal with adaptation to climate change. The purpose of the present study is to assess gender-related awareness of climate change issues and the engagement of citizens in climate change mitigation based on eco-feminism theory to the socio-cultural features of citizen households in Iran. To this end, 310 residents of Quemshahr in Mazandaran province (Iran) were selected with a random sampling method. The results show that while women's behavioral engagement in tackling climate change is high, men exhibit a high level of cognitive dimension of engagement in tackling climate change. Furthermore, the results show that the level of citizens' engagement varies by education and age. Based on the research findings, activities to promote environmental education and understanding of climate change mitigation policies are proposed to increase the level of knowledge of the target group.

328,Informed adaptation: Ethical considerations for adaptation researchers and decision-makers,,2015-01-01,"Given the significant and irreversible impacts of climate change on communities and the environment, there is increasing focus on how to best support decision-makers to adapt to climate change. Generally, the research on this tends to focus on assessing how decision-makers navigate elements of risk and uncertainty in deciding to what extent they should adapt their practice if at all, however, scientific researchers also have a key role to play in supporting these adaptation decisions. Given the applied nature of adaptation research, we argue that an examination of the roles and responsibilities of researchers is critical to understanding the ethical aspects of professional research practice in the adaptation context. This includes identifying how researchers can best support adaptation, and exploring the responsibilities that researchers have, not only to decision-makers but also to the broader membership of the adaptation community. In this paper we examine the ethical responsibility of researchers in supporting decision-makers to adapt to climate change, using agricultural producers as a case-study and focal group. Specifically, in undertaking this examination of risk and responsibility in adaptation research and decision-making, we use the lens of professional ethics to outline how research might better contribute to informed adaptation. We argue that clarifying the distinction between the research and operational aspects of agricultural adaptation, and how the interface between the two is disclosed, is critical. We also describe and explore the ethical considerations of researchers associated with stakeholder engagement in relation to adaptation science, and identify the need for institutional innovation for more effective engagement. In doing so, we seek to demonstrate how ethical research practice can support greater alignment of science and public values in agricultural adaptation, thus increasing the likely success of decisions.

329,"Adapting transportation to climate change on federal lands in Washington State, USA",,2015-01-01,"Research scientists collaborated with federal land managers of two national parks and two national forests to conduct a climate change vulnerability assessment and to identify adaptation strategies for a transportation network covering 28,900 km of roads and trails in north-central Washington, U.S.A. The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement. Many adaptation options are ""no regrets"" approaches to changes in climate projected for the 2040s and 2080s that can be applied to other resource sectors and mountainous regions.",,,,247.0
330,The dynamics of vulnerability: why adapting to climate variability will not always prepare us for climate change,,2015-01-01,"Recent reports and scholarship suggest that adapting to current climate variability may represent a no regrets' strategy for adapting to climate change. Addressing adaptation deficits' and other approaches that target existing vulnerabilities are helpful for responding to current climate variability, but we argue that they may not be sufficient for adapting to climate change. Through a review and unique synthesis of the natural hazards and climate adaptation literatures, we identify why the dynamics of vulnerability matter for adaptation efforts. We draw on vulnerability theory and the natural hazards and climate adaptation literatures to outline how adaptation to climate variability, combined with the shifting societal landscape can sometimes lead to unintended consequences and increased vulnerability. Moreover, we argue that public perceptions of risk associated with current climate variability do not necessarily position communities to adapt to the impacts from climate change. We suggest that decision makers faced with adapting to climate change must consider the dynamics of vulnerability in a connected systemhow choices made in one part of the system might impact other valued outcomes or even create new vulnerabilities. We conclude by suggesting the need for greater engagement with various publics on the tradeoffs involved in adaptation action and for improving communication about the complicated nature of the dynamics of vulnerability.

332,Integrating the effects of flood experience on risk perception with responses to changing climate risk,,2014-01-01,"Flood management decision-makers face significant challenges as the climate changes. The perceptions of those affected by floods are critical to the successful implementation of adaptation responses; risk perceptions are affected by how information is communicated and, in turn, perceptions influence expectations on flood risk managers to respond. The links between flood experience, risk perception, and responses by individual households were examined in the Hutt Valley, New Zealand, through a household survey, a workshop and interviews with local government practitioners. Two propositions were tested: (1) that flood experience can influence flood risk perceptions; and (2) that flood experience can stimulate increased risk reduction and adaptation actions where changing climate risk is likely. Perceptions of responsibility for flood management were also examined. The study found that previous flood experience contributes to heightened perception of risk, increased preparedness of households, greater willingness to make household-level changes, greater communication with councils, and more advocacy for spatial planning to complement existing structural protection. Flood-affected households had a stronger preference for central government and communities having flood risk responsibilities, in addition to local government. Those who lacked experience were more likely to be normalised to their prior benign experiences and thus optimistic about flood consequences. These results suggest that harnessing positive aspects of experience and communication of changing risk through engagement strategies could help shift the focus from citizens' expectation that governments will always provide protection, to a citizen-local government-central government dialogue about the changing character of flood risk and its implications, and build a 'risk conscious' society in which 'sharing and bearing' is considered desirable.",,,,260.0
333,"""There is nothing political in it"": triggers of local political leaders' engagement in climate adaptation",,2015-01-01,"Local government is attributed a vital role in climate-change adaptation. Previous studies contend that conflicting priorities, insufficient institutional incentives and knowledge of risks, and inadequate resources all impede local climate adaptation. Though the importance of local political support in enabling climate adaptation is widely acknowledged, the views of local politicians have rarely been analysed. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with local politicians in Sweden, we explore what affects their engagement in climate adaptation. The study claims that climate adaptation contrary to mitigation is not viewed as political beyond directing attention and sanctioning guidelines set by officials. A limited number of interviewees claim a more strategic political role in adaptation. The combined effect of institutional incentives (e.g. fragmented national guidelines, unappealing goals, and lack of funding), relative weight in local politics, and ability to exercise political leadership (e.g. campaign value, public and media pressure, and lack of ideology) is perceived as too insignificant to trigger strong political engagement. In less-populous municipalities, adaptive measures were highly valued for demonstrating political action.",,,,168.0

335,Observations on the role of the private sector in the UNFCCC's loss and damage of climate change work program,,2015-01-01,"Private sector engagement, particularly in times of public budget constraints, has become a buzz word in most policy areas, yet roles and responsibilities between public and private sectors remain indistinct. We investigate this for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) work stream on addressing loss and damage (L&D). This paper presents evidence of current engagement and expectations, from official submissions to the UNFCCC, L&D literature, and relates this to experiences from the fields of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). Results show a degree of 'vagueness' in outlining the role of the private sector with unclear conceptual boundaries of L&D, DRR and CCA posing challenges for stakeholders. Expectation that the private sector will support the emerging L&D framework through knowledge, skills and resource, particularly in developed countries, is apparent. Further clarity on expectations and the ability to deliver by the private sector is required.",,,,150.0
336,Studying local climate adaptation: A heuristic research framework for comparative policy analysis,,2015-01-01,"Climate change poses a significant risk for communities, and local governments around the world have begun responding by developing climate adaptation policies. Scholarship on local adaptation policy has proliferated in recent years, but insufficient attention has been paid to operationalization of the unit of analysis, and methods employed are typically inadequate to draw inferences about variation across cases. This article seeks to contribute to the conceptual and methodological foundations of a research agenda for comparative analysis of local adaptation policies and policy-making. Synthesizing insights from policy studies literature and existing adaptation research, the article identifies and operationalizes two aspects of public policy policy content and policy process which are salient objects of comparative analysis that typically vary from one community to another. The article also addresses research design, outlining a comparative case study methodology that incorporates various qualitative analytical techniques as the vehicle to examine these policy elements in empirical settings.

338,"Aligning Climate Change Adaptation Planning with Adaptive Governance: Lessons from Exeter, NH",,2015-01-01,"Adaptive governance has been recognized as an integrative approach for analyzing the social, institutional, ecologic, and economic aspects of decision-making to build resilience against climate change. Although closely aligned with adaptive co-management and ecosystem management, adaptive governance is a distinct framework that explicitly focuses on decentralized decision-making through social processes such as collaborative learning, networking, and the promotion of cross-sectoral partnerships to enhance adaptive capacity. In this paper, we explore an ongoing engagement process for climate change adaptation planning in Exeter, New Hampshire, and its alignment with key principles of adaptive governance. Climate change poses multiple challenges to Exeter, including increased flooding, reduced low flows, water quality degradation, and associated threats to estuarine ecosystems and public health. Engagement strategies include community conversations, workshops, experiential activities, and a community advisory board comprised of different stakeholder representatives (Citizens' Working Group) collaborating with the scientific team on water resources modeling and scenario analysis. We present important lessons about conveying expectations and timeframes of technical modeling to participants, developing multiple forums for interaction between researchers and other stakeholders, and making climate change locally relevant to residents by drawing connections to the community's experiences, cultural memory, values, and upcoming decisions. This study contributes to the literature on adaptive governance and climate change adaptation by evaluating stakeholder involvement in a local institutional setting, an important arena where adaptation decisions must be deliberated. It is also among the first studies to evaluate the ways in which a climate change adaptation stakeholder engagement process aligns with adaptive governance principles, particularly through boundary objects and experiences.",,,,257.0
339,Developing rural community health risk assessments for climate change: a Tasmanian pilot study,,2015-01-01,"Introduction: This article examines the development and pilot implementation of an approach to support local community decision-makers to plan health adaptation responses to climate change. The approach involves health and wellbeing risk assessment supported through the use of an electronic tool. While climate change is a major foreseeable public health threat, the extent to which health services are prepared for, or able to adequately respond to, climate change impact-related risks remains unclear. Building health decision-support mechanisms in order to involve and empower local stakeholders to help create the basis for agreement on these adaptive actions is an important first step. The primary research question was 'What can be learned from pilot implementation of a community health and well-being risk assessment (CHWRA) information technology-based tool designed to support understanding of, and decision-making on, local community challenges and opportunities associated with health risks posed by climate change?' Methods: The article examines the complexity of climate change science to adaptation translational processes, with reference to existing research literature on community development. This is done in the context of addressing human health risks for rural and remote communities in Tasmania, Australia. This process is further examined through the pilot implementation of an electronic tool designed to support the translation of physically based climate change impact information into community-level assessments of health risks and adaptation priorities. The procedural and technical nature of the CHWRA tool is described, and the implications of the data gathered from stakeholder workshops held at three rural Tasmanian local government sites are considered and discussed. Results: Bushfire, depression and waterborne diseases were identified by community stakeholders as being potentially 'catastrophic' health effects 'likely' to 'almost certain' to occur at one or more Tasmanian rural sites-based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change style of assessment. Consensus statements from stakeholders also suggested concern with regard to managing the ways that climate change can multiply socioeconomic and health outcome inequality. Above all, stakeholder responses emphasised the importance of an applied, complexity-oriented understanding of how climate and climate change impacts affect local communities and local services to compromise the overall quality of human health in these communities. Conclusions: Complex community-level assessments about climate change and related health risks and responses can be captured electronically in ways that offer potentially actionable information about priorities for health sector adaptation, as a first step in planning. What is valuable about these community judgements is the creation of shared values and commitments. Future iteration of the IT tool could include decision-support modules to support best practice health sector adaptation scenarios, providing participants with opportunities to develop their know-how about health sector adaptation to climate change. If managed carefully, such tools could work within a balanced portfolio of measures to help reduce the rising health burden from climate change.",,,,460.0
340,Public engagement and climate adaptation: insights from three local governments in Australia,,2015-01-01,"Public participation in decision making is a central component of the planning process; however, implementing effective engagement initiatives to resolve complex planning and policy problems, such as climate change, is challenging for planners. These challenges are particularly acute in coastal communities throughout Australia, where many settlements are at risk of future climate perturbations. Using the International Association for Public Participation framework for public participation, we analyse three local government led public participation initiatives in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, Australia. Our analysis suggests there are three critical factors that can influence the level of public participation in the context of climate change adaptation: the technocratic approach to decision making; absent high order government support; and the lack of evaluation mechanisms for public participation.",,,,124.0
341,Not a panacea: private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance in developing countries,,2015-01-01,"The role of the private sector in climate finance is increasingly emphasized in international political debates. Knowledge of private engagement in mitigating climate change and in more advanced economies is growing, but the evidence base for private-sector engagement in climate change adaptation in developing countries remains weak. Starting from the premise that the private sector's role in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant, this article first analyses the potential of private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation financing in developing countries by conceptualizing the private sector's roles and motivation therein. For further inquiry, and for a discussion based on a developing-country context, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders for adaptation of Zambia's agricultural sector, including on ways in which the government can incentivize private-sector engagement in adaptation.How much private-sector adaptation and adaptation finance can be identified depends on the interpretation of the concept of adaptation. Under a broad interpretation, the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation, both directly and indirectly, through its investments and activities. However, the international private sector's role in financing adaptation should be analysed under a strict interpretation of adaptation and appears limited.Policy relevanceInternational political debates increasingly stress the importance of private climate finance, yet are constrained by vagueness around the private sector's role in adaptation finance. This article conceptualizes and scrutinizes private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance in developing countries. It concludes that the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation in direct and indirect ways, and that domestic policies incentivize such contributions. However, international private financing of adaptation is more limited and its analysis requires a stricter interpretation of adaptation. Private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance can supplement, but not substitute for, public investments in adaptation. These limitations are particularly important when discussing private adaptation finance as part of the developed countries' pledge to mobilize US$100 billion of climate finance per annum from 2020 onwards.",,,,319.0
342,Making climate change visible: A critical role for landscape professionals,,2015-01-01,"The central message of this essay is to make climate change more visible and meaningful to community members through landscape architectural techniques and building literacy. It identifies general principles for opening people's eyes to climate change, demonstrating the potentially powerful role that landscape can play in helping citizens to see and foresee climate change in their own backyards, where they care the most. In this context, the author emphasizes the value of local landscape & place-based experience, as well as the importance of designing visible solutions. The essay describes two linked frameworks that address respectively the possibility of seeing and recognizing climate change, and the need to consider not only climate change impacts but also its causes, mitigation and adaptation solutions. Landscape architects and landscape planners can play an integrative, educational & visionary role in creative design and engagement of communities on climate change. The essay offers four pathways for landscape professionals to integrate & enhance public engagement and literacy on climate change, through: applying landscape messaging to make climate change more visible on the ground; using compelling visual tools that reveal signs of climate change in local landscapes and depict resilient, low-carbon futures; local climate change visioning processes to help communities understand the implications for communities; and helping neighbours to self-educate and mobilize for local climate change action. Better training and a professionally endorsed code of ethics for visual media are needed to support this vital work. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,,244.0

This qualitative research reviews attitudes and understandings of the relationship between public health and the environment and the priorities, aspirations and challenges of a newly established group (the Oceania EcoHealth Chapter) who are attempting to promote these principles. Ten semi-structured interviews with Oceania EcoHealth Chapter members highlighted the important role such groups can play in informing organisations working in the Oceania region to improve both public health and environmental outcomes simultaneously. Participants of this study emphasise the need to elevate Indigenous knowledge in Oceania and the role regional groups play in this regard.

344,Climate-adaptive technological change in a small region: A resource-based scenario approach,,2015-01-01,"Society at large must find technological pathways capable of mitigating climate change. But small regions - where private and public sector decision makers take actions whose aggregated effects shape those broader pathways - are faced with the need to adapt to climate impacts over which they have little control. Such impacts already include not only direct climatological ones, but also related systemic shifts in technologies, markets, and policies. Firms and policymakers can widen the range of adaptation opportunities by exploring regional resources applicable to emergent clusters, through which technologically related inter-organizational dynamics may permit more effective climate responses. As in the resource-based view of the firm underlying cluster theory, key decision fields are chosen based on existing capabilities internal to the region in relation to the threats and opportunities transmitted by external climate change impacts. Adaptive strategy options at the regional level can be identified and assessed using a scenario-building methodology that incorporates the interactions among multiple variables and decision-makers' actions over time. Stakeholder input and engagement during the research process can facilitate realism and traction. This methodology is applied to northwestern Pennsylvania, on Lake Erie, projecting a scenario based on a set of complementary, lower-carbon energy and transportation technologies.

345,Resilience projects as experiments: implementing climate change resilience in Asian cities,,2015-01-01,"The capacity of actors and institutions to learn and reorganize is central to the resilience of complex systems, particularly in the context of rapidly urbanizing cities. A process of qualitative, reflective research among practitioners within the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) showed that development projects and programmes can contribute meaningfully to this capacity when they introduce projects as experiments. While projects did provide desired tangible benefits to certain groups of actors, many of the most significant contributions to resilience were related to knowledge, networks, information, and greater engagement of citizens with the state. This emphasis on the capacity to learn and reorganize provides a counterpoint to ideas around implementation and mainstreaming normally promoted within climate change adaptation practice - and, importantly, can help enrich these practices to maximize their effectiveness. This paper focuses on international development projects in particular, although findings have implications for other types of adaptation and resilience initiatives supported by governments, private sector, or community-based organizations.",,,,161.0
346,Climate change and Aotearoa New Zealand,,2015-01-01,"With a population of 4.5 million, New Zealand's contribution to total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is relatively low. On a per capita basis, however, New Zealand's GHG emissions are the fifth highest among Annex 1 countries, due in part to the relative size of the pastoral agricultural sector. Biophysical impacts of climate change will largely extend current climate trends, with high regional variability. A review of climate change literature identifies three key risks for New Zealand relating to economic connectedness, perceptions of clean, green' New Zealand, and social equity. Since 2008, New Zealand's main mitigation response has been the emissions trading scheme (NZ ETS), yet the ETS is currently providing little by way of meaningful incentives for behavior change and low-carbon investment. Moreover, since declining to enter the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol, engagement with global climate governance has been modest, and recently released emissions reduction targets have raised questions over New Zealand's responsibilities as a global citizen. In this paper, adaptive responses are considered in connection to key industries (agriculture, tourism) and communities (coastal, Mori), and examine the devolved structure of adaptation. Mainstream media reporting of climate change in New Zealand appears to be aligned with the scientific consensus position, yet it continues to frame climate change as a political issue, prioritizing political over scientific voices. Public perceptions of climate change provide evidence of continued uncertainty relating to human attribution, and depict climate change as a spatially distanced risk which could affect support for government action on climate change.

347,"Improving Public Engagement With Climate Change: Five ""Best Practice"" Insights From Psychological Science",,2015-01-01,"Despite being one of the most important societal challenges of the 21st century, public engagement with climate change currently remains low in the United States. Mounting evidence from across the behavioral sciences has found that most people regard climate change as a nonurgent and psychologically distant riskspatially, temporally, and sociallywhich has led to deferred public decision making about mitigation and adaptation responses. In this article, we advance five simple but important best practice insights from psychological science that can help governments improve public policymaking about climate change. Particularly, instead of a future, distant, global, nonpersonal, and analytical risk that is often framed as an overt loss for society, we argue that policymakers should (a) emphasize climate change as a present, local, and personal risk; (b) facilitate more affective and experiential engagement; (c) leverage relevant social group norms; (d) frame policy solutions in terms of what can be gained from immediate action; and (e) appeal to intrinsically valued long-term environmental goals and outcomes. With practical examples we illustrate how these key psychological principles can be applied to support societal engagement and climate change policymaking.",,,,183.0
348,Community engagement on adaptation: Meeting a growing capacity need,,2015-01-01,"Climate change adaptation - to be politically feasible and socially acceptable - will not happen without broad public support. Yet, to date, the public has been barely engaged in finding effective solutions. Municipal and county staff, as well as community organizations that have taken the lead to date with climate planning, list building political and public support as one of the greatest barriers they face. As climate change impacts increase, and as adaptation measures move from the planning to the implementation stage, those affected by climate risks and adaptation strategies cannot be ignored. The community level is where climate change impacts manifest, where appropriate solutions are needed, and where synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, and between climate and nonclimate-policy choices play out. It is in specific locales where people live with the consequences of adaptation choices, and where a sense of place can be a motivation or hindrance to action. Local adaptation experts face a growing need to build capacity in effective stakeholder engagement in responding to climate impacts yet opportunities for doing so have been limited to date. This critical gap must be filled and training programs rapidly brought to scale for adaptation efforts to advance successfully. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,207.0

Six forms of participation in urban adaptation are identified from the literature and the distinguishing characteristics and use of each type are examined across the cases.

350,"Preaching to different choirs: How to motivate dismissive, uncommitted, and alarmed audiences to adapt to climate change?",,2016-01-01,"People vary considerably in terms of their knowledge, beliefs, and concern about climate change. Thus, an important challenge for climate change communicators is how to most effectively engage different types of audiences. This study aimed to identify distinct audience segments that vary in terms of their values, beliefs, and responses to climate change and determine for each segment which specific message attributes increased motivation to engage in climate adaptation. A sample of 1031 Australian residents (aged 18-66 years) completed an online survey assessing their values, beliefs, and behaviors related to climate change, and recording their responses to a broad range of climate change adaptation messages. Latent profile analysis identified three distinct audience segments: alarmed (34.4%), uncommitted (45.2%), and dismissive (20.3%). Sixty climate change adaptation messages were coded in terms of the presence/absence of six attributes: explicit reference to climate change, providing specific adaptation advice, strong negative emotive content, emphasis on collective responsibility, highlighting local impacts, and underscoring financial impacts. Participants viewed a random sample of six messages and rated the extent to which each message motivated them to seek out more information and immediately respond to the climate change threat portrayed in the message. Multilevel modeling indicated messages that included strong negative emotive content or provided specific adaptation advice increased adaptation intentions in all three audience segments. Omitting any mention of climate change and emphasizing local impacts increased adaptation intentions in dismissive audiences. Implications for tailoring and targeting climate change adaptation messages are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,251.0
351,Fostering Resilience in the Face of an Uncertain Future: Using Scenario Planning to Communicate Climate Change Risks and Collaboratively Develop Adaptation Strategies,,2016-01-01,"Communicating about climate change is a serious challenge. There is an urgent need to develop effective processes at the local level to engage, inform, and support decision-makers in their efforts to plan for the impacts of climate change. This is particularly urgent in Alaska, where the impacts of climate change are already being felt. The Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks has spent the past 7 years facilitating the use of scenarios for climate change planning. In this case study highlighting SNAP's collaboration with the National Park Service (NPS), we explore how the scenario planning process can be applied to support effective communication of climate risks.

352,Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural and Forest Landscapes for Policy Development and Verification,,2016-01-01,"The emergence of policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated a rapid shift in ecosystem modeling, especially concerning agricultural and forest management effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil carbon (C). First, we review models for estimating GHG fluxes in agricultural and forest landscapes. Second, we investigate the interplay of models with institutions that develop and implement climate change policy. Limited GHG flux observations constrain our understanding of process controls, especially with respect to N2O flux. Even when simulation models explicitly include N2O flux, this capability is infrequently applied or validated. In the policy arena, tools used to estimate aboveground forest biomass C rely on robust inventory data. Such data are scarce outside of the industrialized world. Compared with biomass C, soil C storage in both forest and agricultural systems is difficult to quantify. Widely used estimates depend on critical assumptions such as the extent to which erosion contributes to C loss from fields and the mechanisms by which C is stabilized in soil, both of which are the subject of serious debate. As evidenced by at least one instance we explore, institutions dedicated to policy development and implementation can rapidly achieve a nuanced understanding of these limitations, given sufficient engagement of the research community. Our review illuminates challenges that affect land-based GHG mitigation initiatives as a result of current knowledge gaps, institutional capacity, and decision-making frameworks. We suggest key points that should be communicated to model users and raise questions that could be fruitfully addressed by model developers and consumers of modeled estimates.",,,,256.0
353,"Climate knowledge cultures: Stakeholder perspectives on change and adaptation in Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia",,2016-01-01,"Effective climate adaptation requires engagement (awareness, motivation, and capacity to act) at relevant scales, from individuals to global institutions. In many parts of the world, research attention has focused on the engagement of the general public. We suggest that studies also need to focus on key stakeholders in the government and non-governmental sectors who participate in adaptation planning processes, so that a better understanding may be achieved of the distinct knowledge cultures that influence their engagement with climate change. Indonesia is a key actor in climate adaptation because of the potentially dire consequences for its population's livelihoods and well-being. In this paper we consider whether 'climate knowledge cultures' exist amongst stakeholders at multiple organisational levels in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) Province, Eastern Indonesia. Surveys were conducted with 124 stakeholders from differing levels at the beginning of four multi-stakeholder climate adaptation workshops. Questions elicited perceptions of their region's challenges, observation and awareness of climate change, feelings they associated with climate change, beliefs regarding causes, risks and preparedness for climate change, and timeframes they associated with the future. Across all levels, climate change ranked highest as the first challenge participants identified, followed by food security, but well-being ranked highest when the top three challenges were combined. Most participants believed climate change was happening, but those working at higher organisational levels were more likely to attribute climate change to human factors whereas those at lower levels were more likely to think it was a natural phenomenon. Women were in greater agreement and more optimistic than men about current government policies to cope with climate change. Perceptions differed between sub-districts, reflecting NTB's climatic diversity. We note that although climate change is an issue of concern among NTB stakeholders, the potential privileging of some knowledge cultures may lead to its association with cultural and political elitism. Second, climate change needs to be viewed alongside the myriad other challenges facing NTB, some of which have greater perceived immediacy. This analysis highlights the need for planning that can accommodate and integrate the diverse knowledge cultures and adaptation objectives that exist at multiple levels. (C) 2015 The Authors.

354,Online participation in climate change adaptation: A case study of agricultural adaptation measures in Northern Italy,,2015-01-01,"The new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change suggests flexible and participatory approaches. Face-to-face contact, although it involves time-consuming procedures with a limited audience, has often been considered the most effective participatory approach. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in the visibility of different citizens' initiatives in the online world, which strengthens the possibility of greater citizen agency. This paper investigates whether the Internet can ensure efficient public participation with meaningful engagement in climate change adaptation. In elucidating issues regarding climate change adaptation, we developed an eParticipation framework to explore adaptation capacity of agriculture to climate change in Northern Italy. Farmers were mobilised using a pre-existing online network. First they took part in an online questionnaire for revealing their perceptions of and reactions to the impacts of ongoing changes in agriculture. We used these results to suggest a portfolio of policy measures and to set evaluation criteria. Farmers then evaluated these policy options, using a multi criteria analysis tool with a simple user-friendly interface. Our results showed that eParticipation is efficient; it supports a rapid data collection, while involving high number of participants. Moreover, we demonstrated that the digital divide is decreasingly an obstacle for using online spaces for public engagement. This research does not present eParticipation as a panacea. Rather, eParticipation was implemented with well-established participatory approaches to both validate the results and, consequently, communicate meaningful messages on local agricultural adaptation practices to regional decision-makers. Feedbacks from the regional decision-makers showed their interest in using eParticipation to improve communication with farmers in the future.

355,Planning adaptation based on local actors' knowledge and participation: a climate governance experiment,,2015-01-01,"Involving a wide-range of stakeholders at different moments in the planning of urban adaptation to climate change can help to overcome different barriers to adaptation, such as a lack of common perception, or control over options. This Article argues for an approach that involves a wide range of actors throughout the planning process in order to confront the challenges of urban adaptation to climate change. It builds on the results of a three-year participatory action research project to identify the catalysts with which local administrations can overcome the lack of data, the low level of engagement around the climate issue, and the cause-and-effect linkages of climate change impacts on the urban environment. Significant factors include territorial rootedness, leveraging actors' experience, interaction between actors, as well as the valuing of local actors as experts of territorial management rather than as novices with regard to climate change adaptation. In addition to contributing towards the engagement of a large number of stakeholders around adaptation issues, a planning process that involves representatives from various sectors and during several stages contributes to a greater understanding of these issues and their linkages. It follows that such a process will bring changes to urban practices by better articulating local concerns about climatic issues. Policy relevance Although participation is commonly advocated in policy responses to climate change, only few empirical studies have investigated the ways in which local actors' knowledge can be integrated into climate change adaptation planning processes. The article builds on the results of an action research project carried out in Quebec City, Canada, to address the relevance of involving a progressively broader range of actors as the adaptation process moves through its various phases. Given that a multitude of barriers to adaptation are at play at different times in a municipality, collaborations between local stakeholders emerge as a key factor. These collaborations provide greater insight into the linkages between climate change impacts and the urban environment and, in doing so, bring into question ordinary urban management and design practices.",,,,334.0
356,"""I don't get this climate stuff!' Making sense of climate change among the corporate middle class in Lagos",,2015-01-01,"Public engagement continues to be central to wider efforts to address climate change. This study contributes to public engagement debates by investigating engagement with climate change among an often overlooked group, the corporate middle class in Africa's second largest megacity, Lagos. Combining survey and interviews, I focus analysis on three aspects: awareness, knowledge and concern; role of scientific and social frames in shaping general attitude; and spatial attribution of causes and consequences. The study reveals a universal awareness and high concern about climate change among the respondents, although understanding and perceptions of climate change are significantly socially framed. Social situatedness, more than scientific facts, is the most important definer of overall engagement with climate change. This study thus underscores a nuanced constructionist stance, showing how corporate professionals' ways of knowing' climate change is underpinned by a certain co-production between scientific and socio-experiential frames. I highlight implications for research and public engagement with climate change.",,,,154.0
357,Predictors of public climate change awareness and risk perception around the world,,2015-01-01,"Climate change is a threat to human societies and natural ecosystems, yet public opinion research finds that public awareness and concern vary greatly. Here, using an unprecedented survey of 119 countries, we determine the relative influence of socio-demographic characteristics, geography, perceived well-being, and beliefs on public climate change awareness and risk perceptions at national scales. Worldwide, educational attainment is the single strongest predictor of climate change awareness. Understanding the anthropogenic cause of climate change is the strongest predictor of climate change risk perceptions, particularly in Latin America and Europe, whereas perception of local temperature change is the strongest predictor in many African and Asian countries. However, other key factors associated with public awareness and risk perceptions highlight the need to develop tailored climate communication strategies for individual nations. The results suggest that improving basic education, climate literacy, and public understanding of the local dimensions of climate change are vital to public engagement and support for climate action.",,,,157.0
358,Wildlife restoration: Mainstreaming translocations to keep common species common,,2015-01-01,"In most urban and agricultural landscapes, remnants of native vegetation are surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities.

Understanding these impacts, as well as society's diverse perspectives and multiscale responses to the changing oceans, requires a correspondingly diverse body of scholarship in the physical, biological, and social sciences and humanities. This can ensure that a plurality of values and viewpoints is reflected in the research that informs climate policy and may enable the concerns of maritime societies and economic sectors to be heard in key adaptation and mitigation discussions.",,,,96.0
360,"Flood Risk Management as a public or a private good, and the implications for stakeholder engagement",,2016-01-01,"A move to encourage partnership funding of Flood Risk Management (FRM) has resulted in current FRM measures providing both public and private benefits. Yet, the scales of service delivery associated with public and private goods are likely to influence the form and extent of public participation in FRM. We assess the range,of goods provided by FRM, whether these services are considered to be public in nature by authorities and citizens, and the impact this has upon the level and form of public engagement in FRM. We separate the definitions of public goods into 'pure' public goods which demonstrate characteristics of non-rivalry and non-excludability, and public priority goods which are services deemed as essential to public wellbeing regardless of characteristics. We find that English FRM delivers a range of public goods beyond that of reduced water flows, and that when FRM is considered a 'pure' public good the emergent form of public participation does not increase public awareness of flood risk or encourage investment in private protection measures. When the benefits of FRM are solely considered public priority goods public awareness of flood risk increases, yet disputes arise regarding service provision and maintenance. Importantly, increased flood risk from climate change or increased runoff could lead to the capacity of the public good provision being exceeded, leading to problems of distribution of that service, and reactionary pressure group formation. We argue that the current preference for public goods which reduce individual costs at the expense of public awareness can discourage adaptation, which may be problematic in ensuring sustainable FRM.

361,"Sustainable Development, Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Management",,2016-01-01,"Climate change necessitates changes to the methods and procedures of disaster management. A triggering event results in disaster due to the severity of impacts and sequential, secondary consequences. These consequences result from factors such as the biophysical, social, political, economic, and structural context of the community experiencing the event. Climate change adds an additional progressive factor that increases the potential severity and frequency of triggering events and the vulnerability of communities experiencing the impact. Projecting future climate change impacts is imperfect, with a high degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty combined with the self-organizing, emergent properties that characterize urban systems, demands evaluation of the question, what qualifies as recovery? The manner in which policy is formulated must be adjusted to accommodate the dynamic contexts that may be subject to disaster triggering events. To address this need, disaster management must make adaptive capacity one of its primary goals. This is achieved through a process that combines risk assessment, comprehensive vulnerability assessment, iterative policy development and implementation, and ongoing public engagement. One of the critical aspects to long-term disaster recovery in the context of climate change is consideration of both local and regional contexts. Future adaptive capacity is closely tied with regional sustainability. This connection to sustainability is due to the fact that progressive climate change may further stress systems already being pushed by human development such as water and air pollution, habitat loss, and other degraded ecosystem services. Disaster events can result in the breaking of already stressed system connections. This confluence of events must be considered as part of disaster management. Further, ongoing monitoring of these systems and clear acknowledgement of their role in the ongoing functioning and vitality of a city is critical. Without continuous monitoring and iterative update of management procedures and local policy, communities will not be adequately prepared for an uncertain future.",,,,305.0
362,Earthquake risk communication as dialogue - insights from a workshop in Istanbul's urban renewal neighbourhoods,,2016-01-01,"An important paradox of hazard communication is that the more effectively a potential physical threat is made public by the scientist, the more readily the scientific message becomes normalized into the daily discourses of ordinary life. As a result, a heightened risk awareness does not necessarily motivate personal or collective preparedness. If geoscientists are to help at-risk communities adopt meaningful measures to protect themselves, new strategies are needed for public communication and community engagement. This paper outlines an attempt to develop a novel approach to train geoscientists, using doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in an EU integrated training network studying tectonic processes and geohazards in Turkey. An urban field visit to seismically vulnerable neighbourhoods in Istanbul allowed the researchers to meet with local residents facing the seismic threat. Those meetings exposed the complex social, political and cultural concerns among Istanbul's at-risk urban communities. These concerns were used to provoke subsequent focus group discussions among the group of geoscientists about roles, responsibilities and methods of communicating hazard information to the public. Through the direct testimony of local residents and geoscientists, we explore the form that new strategies for public communication and community engagement might take.",,,,193.0
363,Achievable future conditions as a framework for guiding forest conservation and management,,2016-01-01,"We contend that traditional approaches to forest conservation and management will be inadequate given the predicted scale of social-economic and biophysical changes in the 21st century. New approaches, focused on anticipating and guiding ecological responses to change, are urgently needed to ensure the full value of forest ecosystem services for future generations. These approaches acknowledge that change is inevitable and sometimes irreversible, and that maintenance of ecosystem services depends in part on novel ecosystems, i.e., species combinations with no analog in the past. We propose that ecological responses be evaluated at landscape or regional scales using risk-based approaches to incorporate uncertainty into forest management efforts with subsequent goals for management based on Achievable Future Conditions (AFC). AFCs defined at a landscape or regional scale incorporate advancements in ecosystem management, including adaptive approaches, resilience, and desired future conditions into the context of the Anthropocene. Inherently forward looking, ACFs encompass mitigation and adaptation options to respond to scenarios of projected future biophysical, social-economic, and policy conditions which distribute risk and provide diversity of response to uncertainty. The engagement of science-management-public partnerships is critical to our risk-based approach for defining AFCs. Robust monitoring programs of forest management actions are also crucial to address uncertainty regarding species distributions and ecosystem processes. Development of regional indicators of response will also be essential to evaluate outcomes of management strategies. Our conceptual framework provides a starting point to move toward AFCs for forest management, illustrated with examples from fire and water management in the Southeastern United States. Our model is adaptive, incorporating evaluation and modification as new information becomes available and as social-ecological dynamics change. It expands on established principles of ecosystem management and best management practices (BMPs) and incorporates scenarios of future conditions. It also highlights the potential limits of existing institutional structures for defining AFCs and achieving them. In an uncertain future of rapid change and abrupt, unforeseen transitions, adjustments in management approaches will be necessary and some actions will fail. However, it is increasingly evident that the greatest risk is posed by continuing to implement strategies inconsistent with current understanding of our novel future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

364,Outdoor Water Use as an Adaptation Problem: Insights from North American Cities,,2016-01-01,"Recent efforts to influence the efficiency and timing of urban indoor water use through education, technology, conservation, reuse, economic incentives, and regulatory mechanisms have enabled many North American cities to accommodate population growth and buffer impacts of drought. It is unlikely that this approach will be equally successful into the future because the source of conservation will shift from indoor to outdoor use. Outdoor water is climate sensitive, difficult to measure, hard to predict, linked to other components of complex and dynamic urban resource systems, imbued with behavioral and cultural dimensions, and implicated in societal conflicts about climate risk, modern lifestyles, social justice, and future growth. Outdoor water conservation is not a traditional management problem focused on the water sector, assuming a stationary climate, and set aside from public debate. Instead, outdoor water is an adaptation problem, involving complex and uncertain system dynamics, the need for cross-sector coordination, strategies for dealing with climatic uncertainty, and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders with differing goals. This paper makes the case for treating outdoor water as an adaptation problem and offers a six-point strategy for how cities can better prepare their water systems for the uncertainties of climate and societal change.",,,,197.0
365,Private finance for adaptation: do private realities meet public ambitions?,,2016-01-01,"The private sector's role in climate finance is increasingly subject to political and scientific debate. Yet there is poor empirical evidence of private engagement in adaptation and its potential contribution to the industrialised countries' mobilisation of USD 100 billion of annual climate finance from 2020 onwards to support developing countries to address climate change. This paper analysed 101 case studies of private sector adaptation under the Private Sector Initiative (PSI) of the UNFCCC Nairobi work programme, and examined these against ten 'adaptation finance criteria' that were distilled from UN climate negotiation outcomes. Results show that private adaptation interventions complement public adaptation activities. Yet the ten adaptation finance criteria are not met, which demonstrates that the diplomatic UNFCCC conceptualisation of financing adaptation is dissonant from the private sector reality. For example, while the case studies' investments are 'new and additional' to Official Development Assistance (ODA), their 'predictability' remains unclear. And despite some commitment for 'up-scaling', plans and associated costs for doing so remain undisclosed. Developed countries' role in 'mobilising' private financial resources under the PSI seems limited. It is unrealistic to expect that the UNFCCC alters existing criteria to suit private initiatives, or that the private sector aligns its initiatives to meet existing criteria. This paper advocates monitoring and reporting only of those private investments that principally finance adaptation. This practical way forward would allow private finance to meet criteria such as predictability, transparency, and mobilisation, but would drastically reduce the amount of private investment that could contribute to reaching the USD 100 billion climate finance target.",,,,256.0
366,"Here and now, there and then: How ""departure dates"" influence climate change engagement",,2016-01-01,"Climate change alters landscapes, challenges economic systems, and threatens human and environmental health. Yet, despite real and present impacts, climate change remains largely an abstract risk to most people in the U.S. Using a survey with an embedded experiment, we explore responses to messages about climate ""departure dates"" by manipulating the spatial and temporal dimensions of future climate change impacts in two exemplar cities (New York City and Singapore) among U.S: and Singapore participants. Overall, results suggest that the influence of temporal and spatial features of departure dates is moderated by participants' political orientation and geographic location. For instance, we observed some of the largest effects of our manipulation on the reported policy support of conservatives in the U.S. as compared to U.S. liberals and their counterparts in Singapore. We draw connections to relevant theory (e.g., construal level theory) and consider implications for climate departure dates as communication devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

367,European Climate Change Perceptions: Public support for mitigation and adaptation policies,,2016-01-01,"This paper presents results from a large multi-country study focusing on public perceptions of climate change and relevant mitigation and adaptation policies in Spain, Netherlands, UK and Germany. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to understand the nature of public perceptions of global climate change in different countries; and secondly, to gauge the public's support of climate change measures in terms of mitigation and adaptation policies. Our analysis shows high levels of public indecisiveness regarding the danger climate change poses, which source of climate change information to trust and whether to support any mitigation or adaptation strategies. The high levels of uncertainty present an opportunity to increase policy support and foster behavioural changes in the future through well-designed communication programmes. Therefore, this study has identified several aspects that need to be considered in future communication programmes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment",,,,149.0
368,Transformation toward an eco-city: lessons from three Asian cities,,2016-01-01,"This comparative case study of three Asian cities (Penghu in Taiwan, Seoul in South Korea and Tianjin in China) elucidates the effects of different national approaches to eco-city development and the antecedents of the building of an eco-city. To better understand the Asian context, the three Asian cities of interest were compared with two European cities - Freiburg (Germany) and Samso (Denmark). The effects of the approach to the development of an eco-city and the fitting of its business activities to the local context are investigated. The analysis identifies four transforming antecedents of the development of an eco-city in Asia, which are (1) utilization of a national approach and policy, (2) the presence of a dedicated local public authority, (3) the continuous engagement of local citizens, and (4) an infusion of national capability and business activity. The transformational development of an eco-city in Asia seeks to create a new techno-social regime that is based on sustainable solutions, whereas their respective national capabilities must be emphasized with an eye to efficiency, economy, and effectiveness simultaneously.

369,Farmers' perceptions of climate change: identifying types,,2016-01-01,"Ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture have been set by both national governments and their respective livestock sectors. We hypothesize that farmer self-identity influences their assessment of climate change and their willingness to implement measures which address the issue. Perceptions of climate change were determined from 286 beef/sheep farmers and evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis elicits two components which evaluate identity (productivism and environmental responsibility), and two components which evaluate behavioral capacity to adopt mitigation and adaptation measures (awareness and risk perception). Subsequent Cluster Analyses reveal four farmer types based on the PCA scores. 'The Productivist' and 'The Countryside Steward' portray low levels of awareness of climate change, but differ in their motivation to adopt pro-environmental behavior. Conversely, both 'The Environmentalist' and 'The Dejected' score higher in their awareness of the issue. In addition, 'The Dejected' holds a high sense of perceived risk; however, their awareness is not conflated with an explicit understanding of agricultural GHG sources. With the exception of 'The Environmentalist', there is an evident disconnect between perceptions of agricultural emission sources and their contribution towards GHG emissions amongst all types. If such linkages are not conceptualized, it is unlikely that behavioral capacities will be realized. Effective communication channels which encourage action should target farmers based on the groupings depicted. Therefore, understanding farmer types through the constructs used in this study can facilitate effective and tailored policy development and implementation.",,,,239.0
370,"""Proximising"" climate change reconsidered: A construal level theory perspective",,2016-01-01,"Reducing the psychological distance of climate change has repeatedly been proposed as one strategy to increase individuals' motivation to respond to climate change. From the perspective of construal level theory, decreasing psychological distance should not itself influence people's willingness to act but change the processes that underlie individual decision-making. We conducted two experiments in which we manipulated the psychological distance of climate change. We found that participants with a distant focus relied more on scepticism to represent risks and make decisions about supporting climate change, whereas participants with a proximal perspective relied more on fear when making such judgements. However, the predicted Fear x Distance interaction was only found when self-reported fear rather than experimentally manipulated fear was used as a moderator. Our results suggest that simply proximising won't increase engagement and call for a more differentiated perspective on the effects of psychological distance in the context of climate change.

371,Effects of Visualizations and Information Rich Public Engagement in Planning for Energy and Emissions,,2016-01-01,"Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are significant goals for many cities. Many promote ""smart growth"" development patterns aimed in part at reducing energy use and emissions. However, while citizens may endorse broad energy-mitigation policies, they often resist the implementation of such policies via smart growth and other mitigation initiatives in their own neighborhoods. This study looked at whether public understanding and acceptance of smart-growth policies could be improved if citizens were provided with timely, accessible visualizations about why and how such policies can help reduce energy use. This paper reviews two public-engagement workshops that utilized a collaborative touch table combined with three-dimensional visualizations and metrics that were updated in real time. Working both individually and collaboratively on an urban-design task, all participants improved the smart growth and energy-related performance of the study areas via their solutions in the first workshop, but they did not all further improve the energy-related performance of the areas after receiving additional energy knowledge and metrics in a follow-up workshop.

372,Dakar suburb communities and recurrent flooding: the relevance of social capital and adaptive capacity,,2016-01-01,"A combination of decisions to displace populations from the city center of Dakar to the periphery, the severe drought in the 1970s that induced a massive rural exodus and an uncontrolled resettlement, and increased rainfall since around the year 2000, has produced an apparently insoluble situation for poor communities that endure floods year after year. Before designing actions to support the communities struggling with these floods, we used an exploratory qualitative survey to collect the data needed to analyze the factors that facilitate or impede their mobilization and their capacity to act autonomously. The relevance of social capital was assessed and confirmed by studying existing intra-and inter-community relations and networks and their influence on the capacity to act and reclaim public space. Categories such as mutual support and informal social control, considered as non-exhaustive dimensions of social capital, together with aspects of governance (trust, civic engagement) and the composition of organized groups were used and correlated to various actions. A framework based on social capital offers insight into community collective agency and the type of interventions that can further its empowerment, especially in the South.",,,,185.0

Special attention in this study was paid to the aspects linked to climate change, namely socio-cultural issues, views and awareness, beliefs about causes, concerns, and lifestyle adjustments that people are prepared to make. Vegetation type was considered as the major criterion when selecting Makhado, Mutale and Thulamela municipalities, which together with Musina, constitute Vhembe District in Limpopo Province. Seven rural communities in each municipality were selected. Using stratified proportionate random sampling in combination with weighted enumeration area (EA) for these communities, 366 households were chosen and interviewed. It was found that although awareness of 'climate change' was poor, most respondents understood what it meant and its associated challenges. Increasing occurrence of erratic rainfall and forest fires were regarded as visible manifestations of climate change. There was also strong concern about the effects of climate change on forests and forest-related products. The respondents expressed a desire to adopt responsible behaviour towards the use and management of forests as a climate-change intervention strategy. However, most community members were sceptical about the causes of climate change. Taking all these issues into account, it was clear that activities that would enlighten the people on the causes and consequences of climate change regarding their livelihoods should be carried out. This would help promote awareness of climate change and encourage people's participation in crafting measures that might help mitigate and adapt to climate change.",,,,240.0

376,Exploring social representations of adapting to climate change using topic modeling and Bayesian networks,,2016-01-01,"When something unfamiliar emerges or when something familiar does something unexpected people need to make sense of what is emerging or going on in order to act. Social representations theory suggests how individuals and society make sense of the unfamiliar and hence how the resultant social representations (SRs) cognitively, emotionally, and actively orient people and enable communication. SRs are social constructions that emerge through individual and collective engagement with media and with everyday conversations among people. Recent developments in text analysis techniques, and in particular topic modeling, provide a potentially powerful analytical method to examine the structure and content of SRs using large samples of narrative or text. In this paper I describe the methods and results of applying topic modeling to 660 micronarratives collected from Australian academics/researchers, government employees, and members of the public in 2010-2011. The narrative fragments focused on adaptation to climate change (CC) and hence provide an example of Australian society making sense of an emerging and conflict ridden phenomena. The results of the topic modeling reflect elements of SRs of adaptation to CC that are consistent with findings in the literature as well as being reasonably robust predictors of classes of action in response to CC. Bayesian Network (BN) modeling was used to identify relationships among the topics (SR elements) and in particular to identify relationships among topics, sentiment, and action. Finally the resulting model and topic modeling results are used to highlight differences in the salience of SR elements among social groups. The approach of linking topic modeling and",,,,255.0
377,A stakeholder approach to building community resilience: awareness to implementation,,2016-01-01,"Purpose - The paper aims to examine one local government's efforts to increase local-level engagement in building community disaster resilience. Presenting the empirical evidence of stakeholder engagement activities that increase risk awareness and encourage collective action, the study addresses a key priority for the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Hyogo Framework for Action 2) to identify methods for increasing local-level implementation of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative, case study approach is used to explore the case in depth. A review of literature from the multidisciplinary areas of communication, social and political theory frames data collection and analysis. Data collection includes observation, document analysis and interviews with policymakers, practitioners and local stakeholders to document achievements and lessons learnt from all perspectives. Findings - Preliminary results indicate that strong political leadership and inter-departmental coordination have contributed to engaging local-level participation in disaster risk reduction in the Municipality of Amadora, Portugal. Findings indicate that the implementation of a wide spectrum of public engagement initiatives has increased awareness of hazard risks amongst specific demographic groups and improved community and government capacity to identify and implement risk reduction strategies. Research limitations/implications - As this study is a work-in-progress and data analysis is in the early stages, interview transcripts included in this paper are limited to members of the team and their Director, Amadora Town Councillor for Civil Protection Services. Practical implications - It is commonly acknowledged that to date, achievements of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 largely remain at the national level and have not reached local levels in a substantial manner. Addressing the need for more industry-led research to explore examples of successful stakeholder participation, the paper's findings can be used by emergency management practitioners who recognise the need to merge climate change adaptation, risk reduction and local-level engagement to encourage public participation, inclusiveness and proactive planning. Originality/value - Co-authored by an Australian academic and a member of Amadora's Campaign Team, the paper is a combination of empirical data from one city's practical experience to develop and implement communication strategies in developing and implementing strategies to build community disaster resilience, analysed within a framework of communication, social and political theory.",,,,364.0
378,Community adaptations to environmental challenges under decentralized governance in southwestern Uruguay,,2016-01-01,"Since the turn of the 21st century, climate change and globalization had substantial environmental impacts on the southwestern region of Uruguay. Rural community responses to environmental challenges have been influenced by recent political decentralization governments and programs. This study explores how community governance processes under decentralization influenced the mobilization of community capitals used for adaptation to environmental stresses in four communities of southwestern Uruguay. Research methods include semi-structured interviews conducted in 2012-2013 with key informants from market, state, and civil society and participant observation and minutes from local public meetings and assemblies in four communities of this region. Consultation facilitated adaptive actions by the national government to make national governmental programs and institutions more responsive to local needs. Community empowerment for adaptive actions at the local level was minimal, due to the limited resources that have been devolved, reinforcing historic and current dependency on regional and national governmental institutions for those resources.

Based on field research conducted in Surat, India, across a period of two years, I illustrate how climate adaptation is rooted in preexisting and contextually specific urban political relationships that can be traced through the city's developmental history. Through assessing Surat's experience with recent industrialization, episodes of natural disasters, to more recent engagement with the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, I highlight how adaptation planning, as well as how adaptation is integrated into urban development planning, occurs through processes of prioritizing adaptation against development needs and implementing options that are cocreated among public and civic actors. This case empirically shows how adaptation is mainstreamed into urban development planning, illustrates the trade-offs associated with how different urban actors plan and implement adaptation in the context of rapid industrialization, and assesses how internationally funded adaptation programs are operationalized in the context of local social and political realities.",,,,166.0

A diverse sample of U.S. participants (N = 400) was randomly assigned to different message treatments as part of a 2 (compassion: high or low) x 2 (climate change cue: present or absent) between-subjects factorial design. Results showed that the high-compassion condition elicited greater self-reported compassion and stronger belief that a climate-related humanitarian crisis was caused by human activities, both of which, in turn, mediated increased policy support particularly among political conservatives and moderates (compared to liberals). Overall, these findings add to the nascent literature examining emotions in climate change public opinion and help inform compassion appeals in climate change communication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, it gives insight into what happened to the wetlands, why it happened, how the changes in the wetlands affect the communities living in them, and how the situation could be better managed or regulated in future. The analysis is based on very high resolution (50-62 cm) aerial photos and satellite imagery, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Overall, the analysis of losses and gains showed a 62 % loss of wetland vegetation between 2002 and 2014, mostly attributable to crop cultivation. Cultivation in the wetland buffering the lake shore makes it unstable to anchor. The 2014 data shows large portions of the wetland calved away by receding lake waves. With barely no wetland vegetation buffer around the lake, the heavily polluted wastewater streams will lower the quality of lake water. Furthermore, with increased human activities in the wetland, exposure to flooding and pollution will be likely to have a greater impact on the health and livelihoods of vulnerable communities. This calls for a multi-faceted approach, coordination of the various stakeholders and engagement of wetland-dependent communities as part of the solution, and might require zoning out the wetland and restricting certain activities to specific zones.",,,,293.0
382,Reflections on climate change communication research and practice in the second decade of the 21st century: what more is there to say?,,2016-01-01,"Appreciable advances have been made in recent years in raising climate change awareness and enhancing support for climate and energy policies. There also has been considerable progress in understanding of how to effectively communicate climate change. This progress raises questions about the future directions of communication research and practice. What more is there to say? Through a selective literature review, focused on contributions since a similar stock-taking exercise in 2010,(1) the article delineates significant advances, emerging trends and topics, and tries to chart critical needs and opportunities going forward. It describes the climate communication landscape midway through the second decade of the 21st century to contextualize the challenges faced by climate change communication as a scientific field. Despite the important progress made on key scientific challenges laid out in 2010, persistent challenges remain (superficial public understanding of climate change, transitioning from awareness and concern to action, communicating in deeply politicized and polarized environments, and dealing with the growing sense of overwhelm and hopelessness). In addition, new challenges and topics have emerged that communication researchers and practitioners now face. The study reflects on the crucial need to improve the interaction between climate communication research and practice, and calls for dedicated science-practice boundary work focused on climate change communication. A set of new charges to climate communicators and researchers are offered in hopes to move climate change communication to a new placeat once more humble yet also more ambitious than ever before, befitting to the crucial role it could play in the cultural work humanity faces with climate change.

384,Empirical evidence for different cognitive effects in explaining the attribution of marine range shifts to climate change,,2016-01-01,"The changing geographical distribution of species, or range shift, is one of the better documented fingerprints of climate change in the marine environment. Range shifts may also lead to dramatic changes in the distribution of economic, social, and cultural opportunities. These challenge marine resource users' capacity to adapt to a changing climate and managers' ability to implement adaptation plans. In particular, a reluctance to attribute marine range shift to climate change can undermine the effectiveness of climate change communications and pose a potential barrier to successful adaptation. Attribution is a known powerful predictor of behavioural intention. Understanding the cognitive processes that underpin the formation of marine resource users' beliefs about the cause of observed marine range shift phenomena is therefore an important topic for research. An examination of the attribution by marine resource users of three types of range shifts experienced in a marine climate change hotspot in southeast Australia to various climate and non-climate drivers indicates the existence of at least three contributing cognitions. These are: (i) engrained mental representations of environmental phenomena, (ii) scientific complexity in the attribution pathway, and (iii) dissonance from the positive or negative nature of the impact. All three play a part in explaining the complex pattern of attribution of marine climate change range shifts, and should be considered when planning for engagement with stakeholders and managers around adaptation to climate change.",,,,228.0
385,"Climate adaptation at what scale? Multi-level governance, resilience, and coproduction in Saint Louis, Senegal",,2016-01-01,"This paper utilizes a multi-level governance framework to explain how and at what scale climate adaptation, exemplified by flood risk management, was governed in the medium-scale city of Saint Louis, Senegal. It explores how this policy sector worked toward a ""resilient city'' pointing to gaps between governance as prescribed and as practiced. The paper suggests that strong coordination of climate change adaptation and flood risk management should take place at city level, reflecting the ""place-based'' character of these policy sectors. However, adaptation cannot be addressed successfully at any single geographic scale or by any one category of actor. Effective collaboration across politico-administrative boundaries at multiple scales is required in order to address tensions between competing policy agendas and tackle socio-spatial inequality and vulnerability. We found that public officials at the city and regional state level encouraged some degree of citizen participation in planning and input into adaptation. However, despite emerging networks for city-level coordination and capacity to adapt to flood risks among local residents, there were limitations in how higher-level government and institutions supported the lower levels in vertical and horizontal coordination. In particular, services and investments within poor and vulnerable settlements were lacking. This undermined the capability of municipal staff for local engagement and for diverse groups of residents to become really effective partners with the government in coproducing services required to enhance resilience. More so, it limited opportunities to bring local actions to scale-beyond the city boundaries and toward transitional adaptation and transformation.",,,,245.0
386,Role-play simulations for climate change adaptation education and engagement,,2016-01-01,"In order to effectively adapt to climate change, public officials and other stakeholders need to rapidly enhance their understanding of local risks and their ability to collaboratively and adaptively respond to them. We argue that science-based role-play simulation exercises - a type of 'serious game' involving face-to-face mock decision-making - have considerable potential as education and engagement tools for enhancing readiness to adapt. Prior research suggests role-play simulations and other serious games can foster public learning and encourage collective action in public policy-making contexts. However, the effectiveness of such exercises in the context of climate change adaptation education and engagement has heretofore been underexplored. We share results from two research projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of role-play simulations in cultivating climate change adaptation literacy, enhancing collaborative capacity and facilitating social learning. Based on our findings, we suggest such exercises should be more widely embraced as part of adaptation professionals' education and engagement toolkits.",,,,153.0
387,"Sea-Level Rise Risk Communication: Public Understanding, Risk Perception, and Attitudes about Information",,2016-01-01,"We present the results of a study using a document-based evaluation method to better understand how residents in vulnerable coastal areas respond to risk communications about sea-level rise (SLR) and to determine whether communications localized for specific populations improve reception. Similar to climate change communication, SLR risk communication presents challenges involving complex science, uncertainty, invisibility, and politicization. To be comprehensible and persuasive, risk messages must be appropriately framed and visually compelling and must take into account risk perceptions and diverse viewpoints. Our approach involves assessing people's encounters with actual risk messages to determine their reactions and responses. Participants in this study had difficulty understanding information and expressed attitudes including fear, fatalism, skepticism, and loss. SLR risks were also perceived as both temporally and spatially distant, creating a challenge for communicators trying to convey a sense of urgency. We conclude by considering the implications of audience-focused research for SLR risk communication.",,,,150.0
388,Felt responsibility and climate engagement: Distinguishing adaptation from mitigation,,2016-01-01,"Policy makers and citizens must choose from among a growing variety of strategic options as they try to cope optimally with climate change. As a means of more accurately predicting different types of climate change engagement, we empirically distinguish individuals' felt responsibility for mitigation (FRm) from felt responsibility for adaptation (FRa), and assess support for different climate action strategies (mitigation and adaptation). We surveyed two U.S. samples two months apart, and the replication study confirmed Study l's findings of differing predictive powers for FRm vs. FRa. Each type of felt responsibility, controlling for the other, served as a mediator between belief in global warming (as well as belief in anthropogenic cause of climate change) and its corresponding climate action strategy (mitigation vs. adaptation). FRa predicted adaptation measures but not mitigation measures, while FRm predicted mitigation measures more strongly than it predicted adaptation but did predict both action strategies. We also found important individual differences: people's disposition toward behaving proactively correlated positively with all types of climate engagement, and political orientation (liberal/ conservative ideology) interacted with climate action strategy (mitigation vs. adaptation) in predicting all engagement variables. Comparing levels of support across the political spectrum, the mitigation measures were highly polarizing, while the adaptation measures were less divisive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

389,Comparing Approaches for the Integration of Stakeholder Perspectives in Environmental Decision Making,,2016-01-01,"Including stakeholder perspectives in environmental decision making is in many countries a legal requirement and is widely seen as beneficial as it can help increase decision legitimacy, likelihood of implementation, and quality of the outcome. Whereas the theoretical literature on stakeholder engagement is large, less attention has been devoted to comparing and discussing different methodological approaches. Here, we compare three approaches-multi-criteria analysis, plural rationality theory, and scenario construction-that include stakeholders' perspectives in environmental decision making. We find differences between the approaches concerning the assumptions about stakeholder rationality and whether experts and/or stakeholders are in charge of framing the problem. Further differences concern the type of data input from stakeholders and how it is used by the experts, as well as the role of stakeholders and whether they are involved early-already for identifying options-or later in the process, for evaluating or ranking alternatives analyzed by the experts. The choice of approach thus predetermines the type and depth of stakeholder engagement. No approach is ""better"" than another, but they are suited for different problems and research aims: the choice of the approach, however, has a large impact on the results.",,,,188.0
390,Evaluation of the role of risk perception in stakeholder engagement to prevent lead exposure in an urban setting,,2016-01-01,"Stakeholder engagement is a vital sustainable remediation practice for obtaining useful feedback and identifying societal needs. Evaluating and integrating risk perception of stakeholders into remediation and outreach efforts allows for greater insight, increases the likelihood of success and ultimately, benefits the community by protecting its members from environmental hazards. In this study, we identified risk perception factors that influenced residents' level of concern for mitigating their exposure to elevated concentrations of lead in household paint and historic fill material. Risk perception factors were assessed by an in-person survey conducted in public green spaces. The analysis of survey participants' responses indicated that their perception of risk to exposed lead was mostly influenced by the presence of hazardous materials in close proximity to their residence, the ability to address pollution, and awareness, interest, and individual accountability in mitigating environmental risks. Responses also revealed that residents considered risk of lead and soil pollution as less menacing than the presence of more immediate and perceptible risks posed by factors such as air and water pollution. In addition, the community seemed to exhibit ""optimism bias"" and did not identify itself at high risk to susceptible and immediate hazards, including lead exposure. This lack of concern over lead exposure created a significant obstacle to community participation in state-led education and outreach programs. By integrating risk perception analysis and increasing stakeholder engagement, we can bring more attention to this issue, educate the public about the threat of lead pollution, and efficiently use financial resources to implement a more sustainable solution.

391,Between adaptability and the urge to control: making long-term water policies in the Netherlands,,2017-01-01,"Triggered by recent flood catastrophes and increasing concerns about climate change, scientists as well as policy-makers increasingly call for making long-term water policies to enable a transformation towards flood resilience. A key question is how to make these long-term policies adaptive so that they are able to deal with uncertainties and changing circumstances. The paper proposes three conditions for making long-term water policies adaptive, which are then used to evaluate a new Dutch water policy approach called Adaptive Delta Management'. Analysing this national policy approach and its translation to the Rotterdam region reveals that Dutch policy-makers are torn between adaptability and the urge to control. Reflecting on this dilemma, the paper suggests a stronger focus on monitoring and learning to strengthen the adaptability of long-term water policies. Moreover, increasing the adaptive capacity of society also requires a stronger engagement with local stakeholders including citizens and businesses.",,,,146.0
392,Student Participation and Engagement in Sustainable Human Development: A Value Education Approach,,2017-01-01,"It is recognized worldwide that higher education institutions are key drivers to sustainable development. Contemporary global challenges related to issues of climate change, globalization, growing interreligious conflict, increasing social inequities and environmental degradation confront education in the present era. This paper provides an insight on how higher education institutions can address these global challenges by adopting value education towards human development for a sustainable future. The effectiveness of value education for learners in their personal transformation and how such an education based on shared global values can foster a peaceful, just and sustainable world is examined. This research study aimed at analyzing the relevance of student participation and engagement in value education, Student And Teacher Value Assimilation (SATVA) approach, towards enabling resiliency, managing vulnerability and supporting adaptation among learners in higher education institutions. The sample for the study constituted students who have undergone the value education programme. The results indicated that holistic development of learners makes them responsible and ethical global citizens, equipped to contribute to societal transformation for sustainable human development. This paper will be relevant to anyone interested in adopting a systemic approach to value education for sustainable human development.",,,,192.0
393,A Role for Nature-Based Citizen Science in Promoting Individual and Collective Climate Change Action? A Systematic Review of Learning Outcomes,,2017-01-01,"As a model of communication and engagement, citizen science has the potential to promote individual and collective climate change action. This article systematically reviewed literature that jointly addressed climate change and nature-based citizen science and identified 23 reported learning outcomes. Overall, evidence related to learning outcomes was limited across reviewed studies, but documentation of outcomes that are directly relevant to collective climate action was particularly scarce. Findings suggest more research examining citizen science from a collective climate action perspective is needed. To support future research efforts, results link the 23 revealed learning outcomes to two potential evaluation frameworks.",,,,98.0
394,"Brazilian Media and Climate Change: Analysis of Media Coverage Trends, Approaches and Criteria of Newsworthiness",,2017-01-01,"The media have an important role in invigorating the public sphere and creating a forum for public discourse. This is especially critical for climate change and the public understanding of this phenomenon, including its uncertainties, controversies, risks and threats as well as future projections and coping possibilities. The media offer to the individuals symbolic forms of representing their relations with the phenomenon, and have the responsibility to represent complex issues related to climate change, seeking to connect them to the experiences of modern life. Understanding how the media have covered and diffused these issues is a big challenge for researchers who work on the triad science - communication - society. This paper seeks to contribute to this analytical field and filling the gap in terms of Brazilian studies focused on climate change and coverage, presenting and discussing results of a study conducted between 2014 and 2016, which aimed: (i) to understand the coverage media of issues related to climate change and energy throughout an analyses of news published between 2000 and 2014 in a large national Brazilian newspaper; (ii) to understand journalists' perceptions of media coverage on climate change through content analysis of interviews with Brazilian professionals who cover these issues. Results are presented and discussed considering three arguments: (i) tendency for an event-centred coverage reporting; (ii) change in the coverage trends of climate change along the years; (iii) adoption of criteria of newsworthiness to select information and cover climate change, including sense of opportunity, interest for human and conflict.",,,,250.0
395,Climate change typologies and audience segmentation among Corn Belt farmers,,2017-01-01,"Development of natural resource user typologies has been viewed as a potentially effective means of improving the effectiveness of natural resource management engagement strategies. Prior research on Corn Belt farmers' perspectives on climate change employed a latent class analysis (LCA) that created a six-class typology-the Concerned, Uneasy, Uncertain, Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached-to develop a better understanding of farmer perspectives on climate change and inform more effective climate adaptation and mitigation outreach strategies. The LCA employed 34 variables that are generally unobservable- beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks of climate change, and attitudes toward climate action-to identify types. The research reported in this paper builds on this typology of Corn Belt farmers by exploring 33 measures of observable farm enterprise characteristics, land management practices, and farmer demographics to assess whether variations in these observable characteristics between the six farmer classes display systematic patterns that might be sufficiently distinctive to guide audience segmentation strategies. While analyses detected some statistically significant differences, there were few systematic, meaningful observable patterns of difference between groups of farmers with differing perspectives on climate change. In other words, farmers who believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that adaptive action should be taken, may look very much like farmers who deny the existence of climate change and do not support action. The overall implication of this finding is that climate change engagement efforts by Extension and other agricultural advisors should use caution when looking to observable characteristics to facilitate audience segmentation. Additional analyses indicated that the farmer types that tended to be more concerned about climate change and supportive of adaptive action (e.g., Concerned and Uneasy) reported that they were more influenced by key private and public sector actors in agricultural social networks. On the other hand, farmers who were not concerned about climate change or supportive of adaptation (e. g., the Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached groups, comprising between one-third and one-half of respondents) were less integrated into agricultural networks. This suggests that Extension and other agricultural advisors should expand outreach efforts to farmers who are not already within their spheres of influence.",,,,357.0
396,Bridging the climate information gap: a framework for engaging knowledge brokers and decision makers in state climate assessments,,2016-01-01,"Large-scale analyses like the National Climate Assessment (NCA) contain a wealth of information critical to national and regional responses to climate change but tend to be insufficiently detailed for action at state or local levels. Many states now engage in assessment processes to meet information needs for local authorities. The goals of state climate assessments (SCAs) should be to provide relevant, actionable information to state and local authorities, and to generate primary sources, build networks and inform stakeholders. To communicate local climate impacts to decision makers, SCAs should express credibility, salience and legitimacy. They can provide information (e.g., case studies, data sets) and connect stakeholders to the NCA and its process. Based on our experience in the Vermont Climate Assessment (VCA), we present a framework to engage decision makers in SCAs using a fluid network of scientific experts and knowledge brokers to conduct subject area prioritization, data analysis and writing. The VCA addressed economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change at local scales to increase resiliency and manage risk. Knowledge brokers communicated VCA findings through their own stakeholder networks. We include a qualitative impact evaluation, and believe our framework for interaction among scientists, knowledge brokers and stakeholders to be an effective structure for SCAs and a transformative experience for students.",,,,211.0
397,Risky business: Engaging the public on sea level rise and inundation,,2016-01-01,"To examine whether U.S. public opinion may become as sharply polarized on adaptation responses as it has been on mitigation policies, we surveyed a sample of urban coastal residents in Maryland (n=378). We then tested the impact of a community deliberative event (n=40) with small-group sea level rise discussions as a depolarization strategy. Cultural worldviews which contribute to politically polarized beliefs about climate were predictive of perceptions of sea level rise risk. Living close to flooding hazards. also significantly predicted respondents' perceptions of household or neighborhood risks, but not of risks to the entire county. The event significantly increased topic knowledge among all participants and, among those with a worldview predisposing them to lower risk perceptions, significantly increased problem identification and concern about impacts. These results suggest small-group deliberation focused on local problem-solving may be an effective tool for reducing the polarizing effects of cultural worldviews on decision-making.

398,Maritime Archaeology and Climate Change: An Invitation,,2016-01-01,"Maritime archaeology has a tremendous capacity to engage with climate change science. The field is uniquely positioned to support climate change research and the understanding of past human adaptations to climate change. Maritime archaeological data can inform on environmental shifts and submerged sites can serve as an important avenue for public outreach by mobilizing public interest and action towards understanding the impacts of climate change. Despite these opportunities, maritime archaeologists have not fully developed a role within climate change science and policy. Moreover, submerged site vulnerabilities stemming from climate change impacts are not yet well understood. This article discusses potential climate change threats to maritime archaeological resources, the challenges confronting cultural resource managers, and the contributions maritime archaeology can offer to climate change science. Maritime archaeology's ability to both support and benefit from climate change science argues its relevant and valuable place in the global climate change dialogue, but also reveals the necessity for our heightened engagement.",,,,157.0
399,Understanding climate adaptation investments for communities living in desert Australia: experiences of indigenous communities,,2016-01-01,"Climate change is predicted to lead to warmer temperatures and more intense storms within the century in central and northern Australia. The ensuing impacts are anticipated to present immense challenges for remote communities, in terms of maintaining housing comfort, family health and wellbeing, engagement in education and employment, and community services and businesses. About 50 % of the Australian landmass is considered remote and it is home to a highly dispersed population of about half a million people (with 30 % being Indigenous people). Much of the population in remote Australia is considered highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change as they are highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts, with many having a low adaptive capacity. The lives of Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities are strongly influenced and governed by traditional customs, knowledge and practices. Even when living in large towns, people who are strongly connected to their country are able to blend knowledge from traditional and modern sources to adapt to the current climate. This article explores the extent of adaptive capacity of people to climate change in a small remote community and large service town in the Northern Territory of Australia and provides insights about their capacities and vulnerabilities. Results indicate that the social and cultural capital are of greater importance than commonly assessed and provide scope to enhance effective community-based climate adaptation.",,,,228.0
400,Prescriptive conflict prevention analysis: An application to the 2021 update of the Austrian flood risk management plan,,2016-01-01,"Flood events have become more frequent in Europe, and the adaptation to the increasing flood risks is needed. The Flood Directive set up a series of measures to increase European resilience, establishing Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) at the level of the river basin district as one relevant action. In order to efficiently fulfil this objective, the involvement of stakeholders as well as the analysis of their roles, responsibilities, and demands has been considered to be crucial to develop FRMPs. As a result, the hypothesis tested in this paper is that a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian Flood Risk Management Plan is feasible. To demonstrate this, both in-depth interviews and questionnaires to key Austrian stakeholders are implemented. The information collected in both participatory techniques are then used to run a conflict prevention analysis. The results show that (a) improving the coordination among regions and including better land-use planning approaches are preferable to a hypothetical business as usual scenario; and (b) a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian FRMP might be achievable on the basis of both a deep discussion on the state-of-the art and green infrastructure development.

A concern with justice is at the center of thinking about adaptation that is not only resilient, but also public, engaging, and transformative. Theoretically, the intersection of adaptation, transformation, and environmental and climate justice is examined, before exploring the specific concerns and normative foundations for adaptation policy articulated by local governments, environmental groups, and local residents engaged in adaptation planning in Australia. Despite a discursive disconnect between governmental focus on a risk or resilience-based approach and a community concern with the vulnerability of basic needs and capabilities of everyday life, deliberative engagement in adaptation planning can both address issues of justice and represent a transformative practice.",,,,124.0
402,Moral reasoning in adaptation to climate change,,2017-01-01,"Moral foundations theory argues that moral reasoning is widely observed and fundamental to the legitimacy of relevant governance and policy interventions. A new analytical framework to examine and test how moral reasoning underpins and legitimizes governance and practice on adaptation to climate change risks is proposed. It develops a typology of eight categories of vulnerability-based and system-based moral reasoning that pertain to the dilemmas around adaptation and examines the prevalence of these moral categories in public discourse about specific adaptation issues. The framework is tested using data on climate change impact, adaptation, and societal responsibility, drawn from 14 focus groups comprising 148 participants across the UK. Participants consistently use moral reasoning to explain their views on climate adaptation; these include both vulnerability-based and system-based framings. These findings explain public responses to adaptation options and governance, and have implications for the direction of adaptation policy, including understanding which types of reasoning support politically legitimate interventions.",,,,154.0
403,Experience of extreme weather affects climate change mitigation and adaptation responses,,2017-01-01,"The winter of 2013/2014 saw a series of severe storms hit the UK, leading to widespread flooding, a major emergency response and extensive media exposure. Previous research indicates that experiencing extreme weather events has the potential to heighten engagement with climate change, however the process by which this occurs remains largely unknown, and establishing a clear causal relationship from experience to perceptions is methodologically challenging. The UK winter flooding offered a natural experiment to examine this question in detail. We compare individuals personally affected by flooding (n = 162) to a nationally representative sample (n = 975). We show that direct experience of flooding leads to an overall increased salience of climate change, pronounced emotional responses and greater perceived personal vulnerability and risk perceptions. We also present the first evidence that direct flooding experience can give rise to behavioural intentions beyond individual sustainability actions, including support for mitigation policies, and personal climate adaptation in matters unrelated to the direct experience.",,,,160.0
404,"Socio-hydrology modelling for an uncertain future, with examples from the USA and Canada",,2017-01-01,"Socio-hydrology brings an interest in human values, markets, social organizations and public policy to the traditional emphasis of water science on climate, hydrology, toxicology and ecology. It also conveys a decision focus in the form of decision support tools, stakeholder engagement and new knowledge about the science-policy interface. This paper demonstrates how policy decisions and human behaviour can be better integrated into climate and hydrological models to improve their usefulness for decision support. Examples from SW USA and western Canada highlight uncertainties, vulnerabilities and critical tradeoffs facing water decision makers in the face of rapidly changing environmental and societal conditions. Irreducible uncertainties in downscaled climate and hydrological models limit the usefulness of climate-driven, predict-and-plan methods of water resource planning and management. Thus, it is argued that such methods should be replaced by approaches that use exploratory modelling, scenario planning and risk assessment in which the emphasis is on managing uncertainty rather than on reducing it. Model fusion supports all of these processes in integrating human and biophysical aspects of water systems, allowing policy impacts to be quantified and clarified, and fostering public engagement with water resource modelling.",,,,187.0
405,The Potential of Living Labs for Smart Heritage Building Adaptation,,2017-01-01,"This paper examines: smart buildings as part of 'smart cities'; the particular challenges of heritage buildings; whether smart heritage buildings have any specific characteristics; the lack of data to inform appropriate refurbishment and retrofit; the emerging potential of technologies to engage people in acquiring that data and build bridges towards smart heritage, so easing the task of sustaining heritage buildings for the benefit of current and future generations; and 'Living Labs' as a key enabler. It is increasingly argued that there is a need to involve citizens in city development, so urban areas may be rendered more suitable to their needs and social problems be prevented. Meanwhile it is held that the value and significance of Heritage buildings and landscapes needs to be maintained, despite increasing pressures to adapt all building stock to address climate change and reduce increasingly expensive energy use. To convincingly engage citizens, such adaptation needs to enhance rather than reduce quality of life for users. Over the last decade there has been a move to repeated post-occupancy evaluation (POE), including some heritage building stocks, to ensure these goals continue to be achieved. Yet it can be argued that the number of such POE studies is limited by shortages of expertise, to the extent that in most cases we still lack sufficient data about the existing building stock, and in particular Heritage buildings, to make reliably informed judgements on suitable adaptation and mitigation measures. Simultaneously the sustainable transformation of Heritage buildings and landscapes into Smart Heritage can be held to be a key component in the metamorphosis of existing cities into Smart Cities. Thus this paper examines how Living Lab processes of engagement may deliver innovative approaches to POE, and thus support the scaling and speeding up of the transformation of Heritage into Smart Heritage.",,,,298.0
406,An Innovative Model for Engagement of Rural Citizens/Community of Bangladesh with Climate Change,,2017-01-01,"Citizens/community engagement (CE) is a ""two-way interaction between the citizens and government(s) or the private sector that give citizens a stake in decision making, with the objective of improving development outcomes"". CE is about human development/human welfare with respect to education, food and health security, sustainability and climate change. This article proposes a new model encompassing some innovative programmes and projects with the aim of engaging rural community of Bangladesh (referred to here as CE) with climate change adaptation and mitigation, climate risks management (CRM) and climate resilient development (CRD) and lowcarbon development (LCD). The proposed CE programme includes: (a) education of rural citizens; (b)-training of rural farmers on sustainable and climate-smart agriculture, climate-smart aquaculture practices and disaster management; and (c) generation of new job opportunities via climate-smart agriculture, aquaculture/fisheries, clean/green energy and carbon sink projects. The proposed CE has relevance with the newly globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The CE programmes will be coordinated by the Upazila (Sub-district) Administration and relevant departments within the Upazila. It is envisaged that CE programmes and projects would reduce poverty, hunger and enhance economic, social and environmental growth and development in rural Bangladesh in a most sustainable way. To implement CE, five levels of engagement strategies would be adopted (inform, consult, involve, collaborate and empower citizens/community). The success of CE on targeted objectives/goals will be evaluated based on costs and time spent, benefits achieved, feedback received from participants via satisfactory survey results etc.",,,,241.0
407,Identifying and understanding attitudinal diversity on multi-functional changes in woodlands of the Ukrainian Carpathians,,2017-01-01,"This paper advances existing knowledge of stakeholder attitudes towards ecosystem-based forest strategies and management practices in marginalized mountain areas of the Ukrainian Carpathians. The principal research question was to analyse the state of affairs regarding multi-functional changes in upland woodlands, as viewed by relevant stakeholders. An ultimate goal was to assist decision-makers in evaluation (e.g. through stakeholder evaluation using the suggested method) and implementation (through stakeholder engagement) of sustainable policy and management decisions. The Q-method, with the sequential application of its correlation and factor analytical tools, was applied to elucidate a range of existing attitudes (e.g. towards the expansion of woodlands under climate change and other drivers) and the spectrum of sustainability (its ecological, economic and social components) to which they relate. Dominant attitudes of representatives of relevant stakeholder groups towards multi-functional changes in forestry in the Carpathian Mountains were revealed and analysed. Key factors influencing the attitudinal diversity were explained. The results improve our understanding of stakeholder priorities and of commonalities and differences in existing attitudes/perceptions, providing some indication of how the diversity of attitudes towards forestry changes (e.g. integration of woodlands in mountain landscapes) could potentially influence sustainable forestry decisions. At times, entirely opposite attitudes (e.g. of the so-called Conservationists and Productivists attitudinal groups) towards forestry practices and key objectives of forestry in the Carpathian uplands were revealed. However, people put strong emphasis on multi-functional forestry offering a range of benefits to people, the environment and the economy.",,,,240.0
408,"Conditions for citizen co-production in a resilient, efficient and legitimate flood risk governance arrangement. A tentative framework",,2017-01-01,"Across Europe, there is an increasing trend towards citizen involvement in the implementation of flood risk governance. Policy-makers increasingly advocate co-produced flood risk governance (FRG), whereby citizens are actively engaged in the implementation of flood risk policy, for example, by taking property-level protection measures. In doing so, they aim to make FRG more resilient, efficient and legitimate [Mees, H., Crabbe, A., Alexander, M., Kaufmann, M., Bruzzone, L., Levy, L., & Lewandowski, J.(2016a). Coproducing flood risk management through citizen involvement: Insights from cross-country comparison in Europe. Ecology and Society, 21(3), 7.http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-08500-210307]. Co-production, however, also raises important questions concerning these aims. In this paper, the opportunities and limitations of and barriers to citizen co-production in FRG in terms of resilience, efficiency and legitimacy are investigated by an extensive review of literature on citizen co-production in other public services and on individual and community-based climate change adaptation and FRG. Based on this, a tentative framework is developed on the required conditions to enable co-produced FRG, which benefits both the resilience, efficiency and legitimacy of FRG.",,,,172.0
409,Urban Waterfront Revivals of the Future,,2017-01-01,"Urban waterfronts form part of cities' critical intersection between the natural and man-made environment, linking the city and its inhabitants with water. In the context of high density urban environments, they are integral to the network of green and public spaces and have the potential to encompass a range of uses including residential, commercial, leisure, recreational, heritage and art offering a multitude of economic, social, environmental benefits. The cases of HafenCity Hamburg and Waterfront Toronto discussed in this paper demonstrate successful approaches to achieving social and environmental sustainability at the waterfronts, highlighting the importance of ensuring mixed uses, public access, sustainable design and construction of buildings and infrastructure including climate change adaptations. Integrated and incremental planning of waterfronts in conjunction with citywide planning alongside careful consideration for greening, urban ecology, biodiversity, and aquatic ecosystems is also critical. In an era of rapidly urbanizing and homogenized waterfront developments, distinctiveness and authenticity derived via meaningful engagement with the local context and via engaging in participatory design processes is of increasing relevance.",,,,169.0
410,Global Warming and Its Health Impact,,2017-01-01,"Since the mid-19th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.",,,,390.0
411,Risk Communication and Climate Justice Planning: A Case of Michigan's Huron River Watershed,,2017-01-01,"Communicating climate risks is crucial when engaging the public to support climate action planning and addressing climate justice. How does evidence-based communication influence local residents' risk perception and potential behavior change in support of climate planning? Built upon our previous study of Climate Justice maps illustrating high scores of both social and ecological vulnerability in Michigan's Huron River watershed, USA, a quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effects of Climate Justice mapping intervention on residents' perceptions and preparedness for climate change associated hazards in Michigan. Two groups were compared: residents in Climate Justice areas with high social and ecological vulnerability scores in the watershed (n = 76) and residents in comparison areas in Michigan (n = 69). Measurements for risk perception include perceived exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability to hazards. Results indicate that risk information has a significant effect on perceived sensitivity and level of preparedness for future climate extremes among participants living in Climate Justice areas. Findings highlight the value of integrating scientific risk assessment information in risk communication to align calculated and perceived risks. This study suggests effective risk communication can influence local support of climate action plans and implementation of strategies that address climate justice and achieve social sustainability in local communities.",,,,204.0
412,"Collaborative Approaches to Flow Restoration in Intermittent Salmon-Bearing Streams: Salmon Creek, CA, USA",,2017-01-01,"In Mediterranean-climate regions of California and southern Oregon, juvenile salmon depend on groundwater aquifers to sustain their tributary habitats through the dry summers. Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work.",,,,230.0
413,Preparing for flooding in England and Wales: the role of risk perception and the social context in driving individual action,,2017-01-01,"Flooding is a major threat to the local communities in the UK, and the risks are increasing due to climate change. Encouraging homeowners to prepare for the consequences of catastrophic flooding is imperative. This study aims to examine the ways in which individuals' risk perceptions and socio-cultural characteristics co-determine the preparedness for flood hazards. It is based on a social survey about household arrangements that can reduce the economic losses arising from flooding and enhance community resilience. A total of 485 responses were solicited from homeowners in England and Wales. Results confirm that the intention to act is socially motivated. This indicates the need for addressing the role of social networks and engagement with local community in enhancing community resilience to flooding. On the other hand, the effect of risk-related considerations is complicated. Perceived severity of flood damage is associated with intended actions, whereas risk characteristics are not. This implies that although providing relevant risk information to the public is crucial, appealing to the feelings of fears and uncertainties is less likely to be effective in driving actions for managing flood risks than has been usually assumed. The findings have practical implications for policy-making and climate risk communication.",,,,198.0
414,Local authorities and the engagement of private actors in climate change adaptation,,2017-01-01,"The local level and private actors play an important role in the implementation of climate change adaptation. The engagement of the private sector and citizens has received increasing attention in recent years. Local authorities' choice of policy instruments, the distribution of responsibilities and the benefits of adaptation as a public or a private good have a bearing on the involvement of private actors. Based on interviews and documents from Copenhagen and Helsinki, we analyse how public authorities' choices, to whom and how they shift responsibilities, can foster transformational, participatory or market-oriented elements of adaptation. The results indicate that local authorities play a dominant role in providing adaptation. Public authorities steer where the private sector and citizens are expected to take responsibilities. This mix of top-down steering, market mechanisms and citizen involvement might reduce the advantages that a shift of responsibilities towards private actors could provide for the handling of climate change adaptation.",,,,152.0
415,Social inequality and marginalization in post-disaster recovery: Challenging the consensus?,,2017-01-01,"Disasters and subsequent recovery efforts often reinforce social inequality and marginalization, hampering sustainable development paths. This paper presents an analysis of inequality and marginalization effects of post-disaster reconstruction from a risk governance perspective. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the Fischerdorf and Natternberg districts of the German city of Deggendorf, severely affected by the 2013 floods in Europe. The findings show that social inequality and marginalization affected housing reconstruction (and vice versa) in unexpected ways. Uninsured groups (such as the elderly and migrant homeowners) received prompt, ad-hoc support from state and civil society actors, while insured homeowners (mostly higher-income groups) experienced ongoing disputes between state and market actors that hampered their recovery. Some marginalized groups could not access state support, as various aspects of cultural diversity were not adequately considered. This fostered, and created new, patterns of inequality and risk. The ad-hoc engagement of civil society was crucial, but insufficient, to fully buffer the effects of inequality and marginalization resulting from formal recovery processes. We conclude that it is critical to give more attention to the interplay, and power constellations, between state, market and civil society actors to facilitate sustainable recovery and development-by counteracting potential inequality and marginalization effects. Increased consideration of cultural diversity and the support of citizens who play dual roles (and can mediate between different actors) was identified to be vital in this context. We thus call for increased research into the issue of complementary city-citizen rights and responsibilities in risk reduction and adaptation planning.",,,,248.0
416,Implementing extreme weather event advice and guidance in English public health systems,,2017-01-01,"Background Extreme weather events (EWEs) can significantly impact on mortality and morbidity in the UK. How EWE guidance is disseminated and applied across health and social care systems, at the local, operational level, is not well understood. Methods This exploratory study develops tools and resources to assist local stakeholders to cascade national 'all weather' EWE guidance across local systems. These resources are also used to evaluate the local interpretation and implementation of this advice and guidance within three local authority areas. In total, five discussion group meetings were held and 45 practitioners took part in the study. A thematic analysis was conducted. Results The main themes emerging from the analysis related to awareness of PHE guidance for EWE preparedness, data sharing feasibility, community engagement, specific conditions in remote rural areas and capacity of frontline staff. Conclusions The relative difficulty in finding where the study 'best fits' on local stakeholders' agendas suggests that year-round and preparedness planning for EWEs may not have been considered a high priority in participating areas. This study adds to the relatively limited evidence internationally concerning the practical implementation at local level of national adaptation advice and guidance and potential barriers to achieving this.",,,,197.0
417,Assessing the Extent to Which the UK's National Risk Register Supports Local Risk Management,,2017-01-01,"This paper examines how a national risk register supports the implementation of disaster risk management practices at a local level. We present a case study of the UK's National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies and explore stakeholder understanding, views, perceptions, opinions, and application within the East of England. A semi-structured interview methodology was adopted for this paper with 14 key stakeholders from across the East of England interviewed. Thematic coding analysis was used to structure the results against a set of research questions. Interviewees were found to be largely unaware of the National Risk Register, and as such its usefulness as a risk management tool is limited. In particular, restricted local resources, limited understanding of risk, and a lack of actionable strategies were highlighted as barriers to action. Opportunities for capacity building at the local level, sharing best practice, and improved risk communication were all identified. The National Risk Register could be used to improve risk management at local levels but more engagement with it at a local level is required.",,,,171.0
418,Applying the Q-method to identify primary motivation factors and barriers to communities in achieving decarbonisation goals,,2017-01-01,"It has been predicted that despite previous reductions, greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland will continue to increase above current levels for the next 20 years. The benefit of mobilising community level action in addressing climate change action has already been seen in many European countries. While Irish governmental policy envisions as necessary greater community involvement in energy projects and other efforts to reduce carbon emissions, little progress has been encouraging or supporting such action. Using the Q-method, this study examined and identified where commonalities exist in Irish communities that have successfully implemented sustainable development goals, in terms of their motivation, attitudes, perceived barriers and opportunities for continued action. Results indicate that participants' main motivations are derived from a sense of responsibility to future generations and the need to live more balanced lifestyles. Results further suggest that short-term central government strategy, poor support, bureaucracy, and a lack of collaboration are seen as key limitations in developing and achieving effective community level sustainability action. This study contributes in understanding how climate change policy can be aligned to the preferred future vision of communities in bringing about effective change in transitioning to a low-carbon society.",,,,192.0
419,Construcciones de la psicología al abordaje de la dimensión humana del cambio climático en Chile (Segunda parte),,2017-01-01,"Multiple studies show that the integration of social and psychological factors in the design, implementation and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation strategies is paramount to address the complexities of climate change. Such factors influence both the perception of the problem and the responses to it in every social system. Considering a multiple level approach that considers institutional, communitarian and personal dimensions the inclusion of these psychological aspects can help to increase the importance of climate change in society, favor a deeper community engagement, improving public policies, and strengthen individual, social and institutional resilience. Although Chile is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world regarding climate change impacts, presenting seven out of nine vulnerability criteria, the study of the social and psychological dimensions of climate change in our country is limited and its importance for policy-making generally unknown. In such a context we organized a literature review aimed at exploring how Psychology can contribute to address the human dimensions of climate change in Chile considering a wide range of topics. To do this a reasonable high number of specialized data -bases and scientific journals were used. As a result of this work we expect to encourage scholars from diverse disciplines, not only psychologists, to digdeeper on these issues in the Chilean and Latin American context to fill this gap in the knowledge. The literature review showed that most research has been conducted in developed countries such as United States, Australia and United Kingdom. This is expected considering the high levels of political polarization about climate change in those countries, either regarding the causes of the problem, the actions needed to address it, or even if it is happening or not. Contrariwise, we only found a reduced number of articles addressing specifically the psychological aspects of climate change in both Latin America and Chile. Interestingly, mainly scholars from other disciplines generally related to environmental management, planning, Sociology and other social sciences, rather than psychologists, have conducted those studies in the region, most of them focused on issues such as social vulnerability, inequalities, poverty alleviation, political participation and agriculture in rural and indigenous communities in the context of droughts or water management related issues. Results of this review are presented in two articles covering five main topics reflecting the most relevant issues identified in the interaction between psychological factors and climate change in the literature. This Second part follows the literature review presented in a previous article (First part). It starts with climate change related topics that are particularly relevant to Latino America mainly associated with social and environmental vulnerability and participation. Then we present an analysis of national and sectorial climate change plans developed in Chile during the last decade to identify the social and psychological aspects that need to be addressed in each of them. Similarly, multiple case studies conducted in Chile are presented to illustrate the importance of these issues. As a result, we propose a framework to organize and encourage research in this area and to integrate this knowledge in policy-making. Four general research topics are suggested: beliefs, values and attitudes; education and climate change awareness; citizen participation; and mental health and social wellbeing. Overall, this review suggests that Psychology's contributions to address climate change challenges will improve our understanding of the complex relationship between people and nature in general and society and climate change in particular. However, to have a significant impact in policy-making, psychological studies need to be part of wider multidisciplinary teams and work at multiple levels, especially close to communities and public institutions avoiding an excessive experimentalism and academicism preventing isolation from society.",,,,600.0
420,"Moving beyond the metaphor, reaching beyond the rhetoric: Social work education in a changing environment",,2017-01-01,"This article explores Australian social work's engagement with environmental concerns through a review of scholarly literature and professional documentation, and suggests the professional imagination and espoused professional identity of social work practice as expressed in Australian social work education share significant common ground with the concerns of sustainability education. This raises the question of why it is that social work has yet to infuse, embed, or otherwise engage with the adoption of the principles of education for sustainability. The review found that social work has developed some momentum in negotiating challenges emerging as a consequence of climate change and other forms of complexity, but remains educationally challenged by the imperatives that follow commitment to sustainability in practice. To move beyond the metaphorical sense in which social work has previously used the term 'environment' requires re-framing of social work education's purview, and rethinking of the approaches used to incorporate sustainability concerns into professional practice qualifications. Principles of inquiry based learning and sustainability education are suggested, as the next step towards integrating and embedding the concerns of the future with revised social work praxis.

421,Enacting collective support for the European integration: Participation in pro-integration action and preference for specific transnational acculturation strategies,,2018-01-01,"We propose that collective support for European integration is mani-fested in 2 distinct forms: first, as engagement in socio-political action by citizens who seek to change their nation and its status in Europe. Second, it is manifested as a transnational acculturation process that impacts on both nations and their citizens. These processes potentially engage social identities at 3 levels: national, European and as supporters of the European integration. Here, we examine these different levels of identification as part of a model predicting collective support for the European integration. To capture the dimension of transnationality, we collected data from 2 Romanian samples, 1 of participants living in their country of origin (N=203), and 1 of participants living as migrants outside Romania (N=196). We found that identification as a pro-integration supporter flows from European and Romanian national identifications and is an excellent predictor of collective support for European integration in both its forms. We conclude by discussing how our findings can be applied to the design of intervention strategies and policies to promote support for the European Union and the integration process in the current socio-political climate (where the unity and the very existence of European Union are under threat).",,,,198.0
422,"'We cannot be at the forefront, changing society': exploring how Swedish property developers respond to climate change in urban planning",,2018-01-01,"It is increasingly expected that private actors play the role as entrepreneurs and frontrunners in implementing climate measures, whereas empirical studies of the position, role and engagement of private actors are scarce. Situated in the context of urban planning, a critical arena for triggering climate transitions, the aim of this paper is to explore how Swedish property developers respond to climate change. Qualitative analyses of corporate policy documents and semi-structured interviews with property developers reveal a vast divergence between the written policies, where leadership ambitions are high, and how the practice of property development is discussed in interviews. In the latter, there is little evidence of property developers pursuing a forward-looking or cutting-edge climate change agenda. Instead, they are critical of increased public regulation for climate-oriented measures. Explanations both confirm previous studies, highlighting lack of perceived customer demand, uncertainty of financial returns and limited innovations, and add new elements of place-dependency suggesting that innovative and front-runner practices can only be realized in the larger urban areas. Municipalities seeking to improve their climate-oriented profile in urban planning by involving private property developers need to develop strategies to maneuver the variance in responses to increase the effectiveness of implementation.",,,,197.0

Public submissions to the inquiry closed on 4 August 2017 and, at the time of writing, some 59 submissions had been made by researchers, public-interest organisations and members of the public, including a number of geographers. A topic of profound significance, climate change and national security warrants deep and sustained public engagement such as that offered by the Senate Inquiry submission process. In this Thinking Space essay, I urge geographers, working in Australia and internationally, to make ongoing contributions to such engagements. The emerging debate about climate change and national security will likely amplify following the release of the Committee's report. Geographic data and analysis pertaining to various aspects of climate change and security are needed in order to shape policy directions and support evidence-based policy making. My contention here is that contributions ought to extend not just from those working at the coalface of climate change risk, for example in political geography, but from all quarters of the discipline.",,,,190.0

These initiatives stimulate engagement and networking among cities and raise public awareness encouraging policy makers to take action to adapt to climate change.

However, how target audiences make sense of such climate visualization has rarely been studied from a communication perspective. This paper analyses how Nordic homeowners made sense of a specific climate visualization tool, the VisAdapt tool. Involving 35 homeowners from three cities in 15 group test sessions, this study analyses the interpretive strategies participants applied to make sense of and assess the relevance of the visualized data.

426,Beliefs and values explain international differences in perception of solar radiation management: insights from a cross-country survey,,2017-01-01,"Solar radiation management (SRM) aims to counteract the negative consequences of global warming and is considered for deployment in the event that mitigation and adaptation efforts appear insufficient. However, because the potential ecological and political side effects of SRM are not well understood, and because SRM will cross national boundaries, an international research perspective on the general public's perception of this technology is required. We conducted an online survey on the general public's perception and acceptance of SRM in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Our findings confirmed the need for an international perspective, as we found several cross-country differences. Chinese respondents, for example, indicated greater acceptance for SRM than their North American and European counterparts. Moreover, results of regression analyses on acceptance of SRM by country revealed that lower acceptability ratings for SRM in Canada and Europe were mostly related to stronger beliefs that SRM tampers with nature. Chinese respondents, by contrast, were more accepting of SRM when they held stronger beliefs that it may reduce the motivation to adopt burdensome climate change mitigation efforts. Although our research-and previous studies-suggest that opposition to SRM remains, dismissing the technology entirely on these grounds and without conducting a careful, cross-national, and transdisciplinary decision-support process to set up an international policy regime seems premature as people from countries that are less prepared to mitigate and adapt to climate change seem to be more supportive of SRM.",,,,237.0

Both kinds of narrative are important forms of ""world-making."" This article initiates a conversation between science and literature through situating, relating, and comparing contemporary climate change fiction to the five SSPs. A parallel reading of the SSPs and the novels provides the means to make links between larger societal trends and personal accounts of climate change. The article shows how literary fiction creates engagement with climate change through particular accounts of agency and focalized perspectives in a different way than how the factors important to challenges of mitigation and adaptation are narrated in the SSPs. Through identification with the protagonists in literary fiction, climate futures become close and personal rather than distant and abstract.",,,,152.0
429,Advancing values-based approaches to climate change adaptation: A case study from Australia,,2017-01-01,"Coastal flooding affects physical and social place attachments. Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation examine how risks to place attachments are distributed within and among communities, with a view to informing equitable adaptation policies. In this nascent body of research, divergent theoretical frameworks and empirical approaches to measuring social values are evolving. While some studies explore the things people value about their everyday lives generally-the lived values approach, others locate specific social and cultural values in geographic space-the landscape values mapping approach. This study aims to compare the explanatory value of these two approaches for understanding the social risks of sea-level rise, and appraise whether either or both approaches are likely to meet local adaptation planning needs. It does this by examining the potential social impacts of sea-level rise in Kingston Beach, Australia, informed by a mail-out survey of the community. The lived values approach identified that the natural environment, scenery, relaxed lifestyle and safety are highly important to local residents, while the landscape values mapping approach revealed that Kingston Main Beach is the most highly valued of eight coastal landscape units. Incorporating the landscape values mapping into the lived values cluster analysis revealed that while Kingston Main Beach is highly important for its recreational value to some members of the community, for others manmade features such as community halls or sports ovals may be of higher importance because they facilitate social interactions. There is potential to further integrate these two approaches to better inform adaptation policy about how lived and landscape values are distributed among communities, where they are located in space and whether they change over time. A deeper understanding of such assigned values can lead to improved engagement with coastal residents to inform adaptation policy now and into the future.",,,,293.0
430,"Community-responsive adaptation to flooding in Kibera, Kenya",,2017-01-01,"Much of the world's existing and future population will live in slums, where the twin trajectories of rapid urbanisation and increased flooding driven by climate change collide. Few spatial planning policies currently address this issue in practice. Poorly planned relocation from slum areas has caused conflict and insecurity, while large-scale infrastructural solutions for reducing flood risk are prohibitively expensive. There is a need to consider how local adaptation measures for increasing resilience to flooding can complement other structural and policy measures. This paper describes and evaluates autonomous, market-based and public-policy-driven structural and non-structural adaptation approaches to flooding in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. The analysis employs a novel survey data set from 963 households in Kibera and extensive community and institutional stakeholder consultation. Results of the consultation demonstrate how autonomous adaptation at the household level is disincentivised by insecure housing tenure, while public-policy-driven approaches are constrained by the lack of effective community engagement. Combining the lessons from this analysis with 10 years of experience in developing public space and infrastructure projects in Kibera, the paper builds the case for an approach to 'community-responsive adaptation' to urban flooding that negotiates these limitations.",,,,194.0
431,A methodological framework to operationalize climate risk management: managing sovereign climate-related extreme event risk in Austria,,2017-01-01,"Despite considerable uncertainties regarding the exact contribution of anthropogenic climate change to disaster risk, rising losses from extreme events have highlighted the need to comprehensively address climate-related risk. This requires linking climate adaptation to disaster risk management (DRM), leading to what has been broadly referred to as climate risk management (CRM). While this concept has received attention in debate, important gaps remain in terms of operationalizing it with applicable methods and tools for specific risks and decision-contexts. By developing and applying a methodological approach to CRM in the decision context of sovereign risk (flooding) in Austria we test the usefulness of CRM, and based on these insights, inform applications in other decision contexts. Our methodological approach builds on multiple lines of evidence and methods. These comprise of a broad stakeholder engagement process, empirical analysis of public budgets, and risk-focused economic modelling. We find that a CRM framework is able to inform instrumental as well as reflexive and participatory debate in practice. Due to the complex interaction of social-ecological systems with climate risks, and taking into account the likelihood of future contingent climate-related fiscal liabilities increasing substantially as a result of socioeconomic developments and climate change, we identify the need for advanced learning processes and iterative updates of CRM management plans. We suggest that strategies comprising a portfolio of policy measures to reduce and manage climate-related risks are particularly effective if they tailor individual instruments to the specific requirements of different risk layers.",,,,242.0
432,'Branching scenarios' seeking articulated action for regional regeneration - A case study of limited success,,2017-01-01,"In this article, we outline and discuss a novel augmentation of scenario method combined with Delphi analysis to engage multiple actors in analyzing complex and contested problems. In particular, we present 'branching scenarios' as an approach that breaks potential chains of perceived causality from the national/global level to drive local outcomes. The approach focuses on generating debate on local agency. The project discussed formed part of a larger research program in North West Tasmania to study the possible processes for economic and social regeneration. In engaging key stakeholders from public, private and non-governmental organizations, the team faced issues associated with participants' geographical dispersal and lack of time. In addition, the region may be considered as characterized by 'lock-in' to extant structures and, perhaps, resistant to the change necessary to achieve economic regeneration. For these reasons, our scenario intervention was deliberately designed to provide a cognitive 'jolt' to these senior, time-poor individuals- seeking to prompt their articulated action to achieve the jointly-held goal, regeneration. We document our approach and evaluate and analyze the degree to which we achieved this jointly-desired outcome. We present a new conceptual framework for broad social inquiry that will promote deep stakeholder engagement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,203.0
433,Impact of socio-demographic factors on the mitigating actions for climate change: a path analysis with mediating effects of attitudinal variables,,2017-01-01,"Socio-demographic factors play a significant role in increasing the individual's climate change awareness and in setting a favorable individual attitude towards its mitigation. To better understand how the adversative effects of climate change can be mitigated, this study attempts to investigate the impact of socio-demographic factors on the mitigating actions of the individuals (MAOI) on climate change. Qualitative data were collected from a face-to-face survey of 360 respondents in the Kuala Lumpur region of Malaysia through a close-ended questionnaire. Analysis was conducted on the mediating effects of attitudinal variables through the path model by using the SEM. Findings indicate that the socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, education, income, and ethnicity can greatly influence the individual's awareness, attitude, risk perception, and knowledge of climate change issues. The results drawn from this study also revealed that the attitudinal factors act as a mediating effect between the socio-demographic factors and the MAOI, thereby, indicating that both the socio-demographic factors and the attitudinal factors have significant effects on the MAOI towards climate change. The outcome of this study can help policy makers and other private organizations to decide on the appropriate actions to take in managing climate change effects. These actions which encompass improving basic climate change education and making the public more aware of the local dimensions of climate change are important for harnessing public engagement and support that can also stimulate climate change awareness and promote mitigating actions to n protect the environment from the impact of climate change.",,,,248.0
434,Differentiating environmental concern in the context of psychological adaption to climate change,,2018-01-01,"Despite existing evidence for the threats of climate change facing people living in the U.S., the psychological impacts of this threat have been neglected in public and scientific discourse, resulting in a notable lack in studies on individuals' adaptation to climate change. Using social-cognitive theory, we examine how three forms of environmental concern egoistic (e.g., concern for oneself; one's health or life), social-altruistic (e.g., concern for others; future generations or country), and biospheric (e.g., concern for plants and animals; nature) influence concurrent ecological stress and ecological coping strategies. Further, we examine how ecological stress and coping are associated with both depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. In an online survey of 342 U.S. adults we found unique patterns of the three forms of environmental concern. Only individuals higher in biospheric environmental concern perceived ecological stress and engaged in ecological coping. In contrast, individuals higher in social-altruistic concern did not perceive ecological stress, but did engage in ecological coping. Those higher in egoistic concern neither perceived ecological stress, nor engaged in coping. In addition, perceived ecological stress was positively associated with depressive symptoms; ecological coping negatively predicted depressive symptoms, while positively predicting pro-environmental behaviors. In sum, with the exception of those high in biospheric concern, study participants did not seem to perceive climate change threats as having a profound effect on their own or their family's life. Differentiating three forms of environmental concern provides a nuanced view on their association with ecological stress and coping, and in turn depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. Results indicate that current public policy approaches that often focus on the natural environment when depicting or explaining the effects of climate change, may limit the effectiveness of interventions to those people who already show high concern for all living creatures, while failing to affect those motivated by egoistic or altruistic concern, increasing the risks associated with delaying climate change adaptation and the potential for large-scale negative mental health effects in our society.",,,,324.0
435,Public Policy Design for Climate Change Adaptation: A Dynamic Performance Management Approach to Enhance Resilience,,2018-01-01,"This chapter proposes dynamic performance management (DPM) as a suitable method to identify policies in the context of climate change adaptation. Namely, it focuses on the role it can play to support the analysis of how to enhance resilience of social and economic systems to climate change. While 'resilience' is a buzzword in the policymaking world, putting the concept into practice is still undeveloped. In a public administration focused on accountability, intangible outcomes of resilience represent a complication. The chapter discusses the findings and lessons from a case study applying the proposed approach. The results highlight the role of a dynamic performance approach to support stakeholder engagement, outcome-based policymaking and integrated solutions in the process of climate change adaptation.",,,,119.0

Its urban planning innovation is in its attempt to demonstrate net zero carbon as well as other sustainability goals set by urban planning processes such as community engagement and the One Planet Living accreditation process. It is a contribution to the IPCC 1.5 degrees C agenda which seeks to achieve deep decarbonization while also delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Solar photovoltaics and battery storage are incorporated into the development and create net zero carbon power through an innovative 'citizen utility' with peer-to-peer trading.

437,Climate-related community knowledge networks as a tool to increase learning in the context of environmental change,,2018-01-01,"Statements made at the recent UN Climate Conference 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP23) clearly indicated that Pacific islands, countries, and territories (PICTs) are particularly susceptible to sociocultural, economic and environmental impacts of climate change. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) are one such group of islands where internal and external climate forcing has observable detrimental impacts on local public health, water quality, agriculture and resource management. Here, we present the outcomes of a collaboration between graduate students and a PICTs-focused non-profit organization to facilitate a climate-related knowledge network that addresses adaptation to climate-related vulnerabilities in Pohnpei, FSM. Through a series of workshops targeting K-8 science teachers, this network strengthens lines of communication between educators, resource managers, stakeholders and environmental leaders and provides a forum for ongoing information exchange to encourage adaptation to climate change in island communities. Additionally, teacher participation in the workshops resulted in a marked increase in community engagement in other local and regional educational venues. We propose that the knowledge network piloted here serves as an interdisciplinary model of a sustainable educational partnership that can be adapted for use in a multitude of PICT communities to improve preparedness and reduce susceptibility to climate-associated stressors, thereby providing an example of means to achieve key goals of the COP23.",,,,214.0
438,Governance for adaptive capacity and resilience in the US water sector,,2018-01-01,"Water utility managers play potentially important roles in current and future transitions toward more adaptive and sustainable approaches to water management. We report the results of qualitative interviews and focus groups designed to explore the perspectives of 22 water utility managers in the United States regarding pressures, challenges, and opportunities facing their organizations and communities. Overall, the study participants characterized their jobs as requiring a delicate balance between innovation and reliability, with no room for error in delivering abundant, clean water, but opportunities for creative problem-solving and forward planning. They demonstrated capacity for embracing changes that benefit the longer term future while imposing short-term costs on their own organizations. Coding of transcripts generated 17 major themes (11 problem categories and six solution categories), which overlap meaningfully with results of previous research on resilience, adaptability, and transformability of social-ecological systems. Overlapping themes include social learning and development of social capital through various forms of collaboration, communication, and citizen and stakeholder engagement, as well as capacity for innovation and sufficient authority to make decisions based on system needs without undue political interference or burdensome adherence to rigid rule structures.",,,,187.0
439,"Public-private partnership in enhancing farmers' adaptation to drought: Insights from the Lujiang Flatland in the Nu River (Upper Salween) valley, China",,2018-01-01,"Agriculture is an important type of land use but suffers from drought, especially under global climate change scenarios. Although government is a major actor in helping farmers to adapt to drought, lack of funds has constrained its efforts. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mechanism has been widely applied in urban infrastructure development to raise fund for public goods and services, but very few studies explored its role in rural areas. Based on interview of 139 fanning households and open-ended interview of village heads, government officials and company representatives, in the Lujiang Flatland in the Nu River (Upper Salween) Valley, Southwest China, this paper aims to reveal how PPP functions to enhance farmers' adaptation to drought. We found that farmers have developed multiple strategies in their own ways to adapt to drought, including pumping and store water, using water-saving irrigation techniques, changing of crops, and strengthening water management at the community level, while insufficient funds, water resource scarcity and mismatch of time-scale of crop growth and drought even hindered their adaptation options. Limited fund sources, gap in policy implementation and weak performance of government-funded projects hindered governmental supports to be effective. Weak motivation and distrusted by farmers limited the engagement of private enterprises in supporting farmers to adapt to drought. PPP mechanism has the potential to mobilize fund from multiple sources, share costs, risks and benefits among different stakeholders, combine both scientific and local knowledge, and reduce uncertainty through formal and informal institutions. Benefited from these advantages, PPP mechanism could improve project performance, thus increase farmers' adaptation options and resilience to drought. This study offers referential lessons and valuable insights for agricultural development, especially for mountain communities vulnerable to exceptional and recurrent drought episodes under warming climate.",,,,284.0
440,Participatory GIS as a Tool for Stakeholder Engagement in Building Resilience to Sea Level Rise: A Demonstration Project,,2018-01-01,"This article describes a participatory geographical information system (PGIS) demonstration project used as part of the stakeholder engagement efforts undertaken by the Citizen Engagement Working Group of the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness and Resilience Intergovernmental Planning Pilot Project. The PGIS demonstration project was conducted in the Little Creek/Pretty Lake case study area in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern coastal Virginia. PGIS served as a deliberative and participatory mechanism to obtain local knowledge from residents about the location of valued assets within the community and locations challenged by increased flooding and sea level rise. The PGIS application, using the weTable tool, was found to be useful for soliciting and documenting local knowledge, such as by highlighting community assets and identifying community challenges. It was also found to be useful for facilitating community-wide discussion, visualizing the problem, and understanding the severity of sea level rise and flooding. The PGIS demonstration project showed how participatory mapping can directly engage residents in creating sociospatial data, build knowledge, and foster learning and deliberation in a complex issue such as resilience to flooding and sea level rise.",,,,184.0
441,Identifying and quantifying landowner perspectives on integrated flood risk management,,2018-01-01,"Understanding landowner perspectives on flood mitigation is an essential step towards minimising conflict and ensuring public support and compliance. To illuminate landowner perspectives on flood mitigation and the drivers of those perspectives, we surveyed landowners in the Deerfield River Watershed, Massachusetts (USA). Confirmatory factor analysis shows landowners differentiate between the physical and the policy pathways through which flood mitigation strategies provide protection. Multiple regression analyses indicate landowner support or opposition for each of those pathways is related both to the risks a landowner faces and to their broad worldviews. Lastly, cluster analysis indicates variation in patterns landowner of support or opposition to the physical and policy pathways through which flood mitigation provides protection. Findings point to how issues beyond flood impacts, including understandings of riverine processes, assessments of responsibility, and interpretations of the relationship between government and private property drive landowner perspectives on flood mitigation policies.",,,,146.0
442,Efficacy of a national hydrological risk communication strategy: Domestic wastewater treatment systems in the Republic of Ireland,,2018-01-01,"A significant body of research has focused on the role of domestic wastewater treatment systems (DWWTSs) as sources of human-specific aquatic contaminants in both developed and developing regions. However, to date few studies have sought to investigate the awareness, attitudes and behaviours of DWWTS owners and the efficacy of associated communication initiatives. The current study provides an examination of a public national engagement campaign undertaken in the Republic of Ireland which seeks to minimise the impact of DWWTSs on human and ecological health via concurrent inspection and information dissemination. Overall, 1634 respondents were surveyed using a ""before and after"" study design to capture if and how awareness, attitudes and behaviours evolved over time. Findings suggest that whilst the campaign provided a modest baseline to raise general awareness associated with the basic operational and maintenance requirements of DWWTS, there has been little or no behavioural engagement as a result, suggesting a significant awareness-behaviour gap. Accordingly, efforts to minimise potential human and ecological, impacts have been unsuccessful. Moreover, results suggest that public attitudes towards water-related regulation and policy became increasingly negative over the study period due to parallel political and economic issues, further complicating future engagement. Future strategies, both in Ireland and further afield, should focus on health-based demographically-focused message framing to achieve significant knowledge and attitudinal shifts amongst specific population cohorts, and thus bring about significant behavioural change. Study findings and recommendations may be used by myriad stakeholders including local, provincial and national authorities to effectively engage with individuals and communities prior to and during implementation of legislative and policy-based instruments within numerous spheres including climate change adaptation, environmental quality, hydrological risk, and hydro-ecology.

443,A media framing analysis of urban flooding in Nigeria: current narratives and implications for policy,,2018-01-01,"A critical element of current flood management is the importance of engaging key policy actors when policy decisions are to be made. However, there is still only limited understanding of how narratives of flood management actors may influence flood management policies, even though there is a suggestion that actors can strategically use their narratives to influence policy directions. In a developing country like Nigeria, there are still questions around lessons that can be learnt from understanding the narratives of policy actors, to unravel the complex nature of strategies and policy directions in managing urban floods. To help fill these gaps, this paper uses quantitative content analysis to explore the frame of five policy actor groups (government, local communities, business, multilateral organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)) as expressed in local and national newspapers between 2012 and 2016 to understand their narratives of causes and strategies to solve the problem of urban flooding in Nigeria. The narratives of government, local communities and businesses align with the premise that flooding can and should be prevented whilst that of multilateral and business actors champion adaptation strategies on the basis that flooding is inevitable and hence more energy should be directed at 'living with water'-emergency response, damage reduction and the aftermath. The study also identified areas of potential consensus and conflict between direct actors such as government and local communities on the one hand and funders on the other. Better discussion among actors aiding understanding of contemporary thinking and local realities will aid policy-making and policy implementation in the Nigerian context. An important step will be in the collaborative design of an urgently needed 'Nigerian policy on flooding' which currently does not exist.",,,,278.0
444,The Importance of Place in Communicating Climate Change to Different Facets of the American Public,,2018-01-01,"While the need for action on climate change is urgent, individual-level behaviors to mitigate or adapt to the problem have not tracked with the increasing urgency for action. Place-based communication of climate change may catalyze action by making climate change more personally relevant. However, there is no one general public, so communication efforts can unintentionally polarize beliefs. This study aims to fill the gap in knowledge about how and why different audiences respond to place-based climate change communication, which could aid climate change communication efforts and climate scientists. Results from an experimental survey of 655 Californians and follow-up interviews indicate that prior climate change beliefs influence the effectiveness of place-based climate change communication. In particular, those who were already ""concerned'' about climate change, as classified by the Six Americas, were the only group to show a significant response to an intervention. This study also finds no difference in willingness to adapt to climate change between local and global framings. However, those exposed to a local framing were more likely to take personal-scale adaptation actions, while those exposed to a global framing were more likely to take policy-scale adaptation actions. These results, and the theories of place attachment and psychological distance, suggest that place-based communication may only be applicable for certain audiences (e.g., the concerned) and when the scale of the intervention matches the scale of action.",,,,226.0
445,Creating climate change adaptation plans for rural coastal communities using Deliberation with Analysis as public participation for social learning,,2018-01-01,"Public participation can foster social learning, creating environments where diverse groups can come together to dialogue about multifaceted societal and environmental issues and values. The case study uses Deliberation with Analysis, a process to integrate local residents' knowledge and values with local climate data, to create climate adaptation plans with two rural coastal Michigan communities. Iteration of the deliberative dialogue process is critical for allowing enough time for meaningful change and constructive communication to occur. Understanding where the community is starting from is important when tensions are high or deeply held values are challenged. Older techniques may need to be used to prepare the community for full participation in a deliberative process. Case highlights include the importance of community identity; potential negative impacts of climate change proposals on land-use rights; and the importance of multiple public engagement opportunities, or iterative learning loops, in climate-change plan development.",,,,146.0
446,"How communication with teachers, family and friends contributes to predicting climate change behaviour among adolescents",,2018-01-01,"Engaging adolescents is critical to encouraging future climate change adaptation and mitigation behaviours. Adolescents are typically more receptive to climate change messages than adults, but educators and communicators need research-based strategies for optimizing engagement, including information about what factors are most influential in changing behaviours. To better understand how communication with teachers, friends and family, climate change knowledge and climate change concern predict climate change behaviour, we administered a survey to a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1371). We measured climate change behaviour with a multi-item scale asking respondents about energy conservation, alternative transportation and engagement with environmental issues. We found that climate change concern and discussing climate change with family and friends predicted climate change behaviour. We also found that students from urban, high socioeconomic status schools were more likely to engage in climate change behaviour than students in urban, low socioeconomic status schools or rural schools. These results suggest that education efforts should leverage communication with family and friends in programming designed to encourage climate change behaviour. Further, efforts to promote climate change behaviour among low socioeconomic status urban and rural adolescents may be warranted, but would benefit from further investigation into the ideological, physical and knowledge-based drivers of behaviour differences documented in this study.",,,,214.0
447,The Dilemmas of Citizen Inclusion in Urban Planning and Governance to Enable a 1.5 degrees C Climate Change Scenario,,2018-01-01,"Cities around the world are facilitating ambitious and inclusive action on climate change by adopting participatory and collaborative planning approaches. However, given the major political, spatial, and scalar interdependencies involved, the extent to which these planning tools equip cities to realise 1.5 degrees C climate change scenarios is unclear. This article draws upon emerging knowledge in the fields of urban planning and urban climate governance to explore complementary insights into how cities can pursue ambitious and inclusive climate action to realise 1.5 degrees C climate change scenarios. We observe that urban planning scholarship is often under-appreciated in urban climate governance research, while conversely, promising urban planning tools and approaches can be limited by the contested realities of urban climate governance. By thematically reviewing diverse examples of urban climate action across the globe, we identify three key categories of planning dilemmas: institutional heterogeneity, scalar mismatch, and equity and justice concerns. We argue that lessons from urban planning and urban climate governance scholarship should be integrated to better understand how cities can realise 1.5 degrees C climate change scenarios in practice.",,,,179.0

Using document analysis and interviews, an in-depth case study of two cities in the conservative Dallas-Fort Worth region of Texas examines how public participation and cultural framing contribute to sustainability and climate change planning. One city successfully adopted sustainability plans, while the other city was unable to do so. Comparison of the two cases reveals that carefully designed public participation processes and locally relevant cultural frames can help cities educate residents, build support and expand discussion of sustainability. However, economic development, competition and political controversy prevent cities from addressing climate change explicitly or in meaningful ways, raising concerns about the capacity of cities to act as climate change leaders.",,,,142.0
449,Resilient futures of a small island: A participatory approach in Tenerife (Canary Islands) to address climate change,,2018-01-01,"Adaptation to climate change has been considered to be crucial to current societies, especially for small islands. In this paper the case of Tenerife (in the Canary Islands) is analysed. Tenerife is a small island located northwest of the African continent, in the Atlantic Ocean. Tenerife presents a high vulnerability to heatwaves and Saharan dust events as a consequence of its closeness to the Saharan desert. In fact, increasing frequency of heatwaves and Saharan dust events has been reported and could worsen in the future due to global warming. An exploration of adaptation strategies to an increase of the frequency and intensity of these phenomena is therefore needed. Different social actors have been engaged in a participatory process aiming at exploring pathways for adaptation to extreme weather events. Resilience was argued as the relevant framing to address those hazards. Four focus group sessions were carried out in order to explore key transformative elements necessary to make resilient futures for Tenerife. The results highlight the need for broader climate-based policies across all sectors to assure that the island becomes resilient to climatic and non-climatic shocks.",,,,184.0
450,Planning support tools and their effects in participatory urban adaptation workshops,,2018-01-01,"In the face of a changing climate, many cities are engaged in adaptation planning and are using participatory workshops to involve stakeholders in these initiatives. Different tools are being used to structure the process and content of participatory planning workshops, but it is unclear what effect the tools have on the workshops and their results. We evaluated three different tools (Group Model Building, the Adaptation Support Tool, and the Stress Test Guideline) and a tool-free approach in repeated simulated workshops, to observe and compare (1) the way workshops played out, and (2) the direct outcomes that were achieved. Tools appear to influence both aspects. Specifically, we measured differences in the learning effects in groups, in the development of shared understanding within groups, in the types of plans that are developed by groups, and in the nature of participation during the workshops. Further research is needed to translate these results into practice, but this is a first step in advancing knowledge about the influence of tools in participatory planning activities.

451,The relative importance of subjective and structural factors for individual adaptation to climate change by forest owners in Sweden,,2018-01-01,"A growing body of literature argues that subjective factors can more accurately explain individual adaptation to climate change than objective measurers of adaptive capacity. Recent studies have shown that personal belief in climate change and affect are much better in explaining climate awareness and action than income, education or gender. This study focuses on the process of individual adaptation to climate change. It assesses and compares the influence of cognitive, experiential and structural factors on individuals' views and intentions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study comes from a survey with 836 forest owners in Sweden. Ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to test hypotheses about the different factors. Results show that cognitive factors-namely personal level of trust in climate science, belief in the salience of climate change and risk assessment-are the only statistically significant factors that can directly explain individuals' intention to adapt to climate change and their sense of urgency. Findings also suggest that structural or socio-demographic factors do not have a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among Swedish forest owners. The study also offers valuable insights for communication interventions to promote adaptation. Findings strongly suggest that communication interventions should focus more strongly on building trust and addressing stakeholders' individual needs and experiences.",,,,208.0

453,Characterizing uncertain sea-level rise projections to support investment decisions,,2018-01-01,"Many institutions worldwide are considering how to include uncertainty about future changes in sea-levels and storm surges into their investment decisions regarding large capital infrastructures. Here we examine how to characterize deeply uncertain climate change projections to support such decisions using Robust Decision Making analysis. We address questions regarding how to confront the potential for future changes in low probability but large impact flooding events due to changes in sea-levels and storm surges. Such extreme events can affect investments in infrastructure but have proved difficult to consider in such decisions because of the deep uncertainty surrounding them. This study utilizes Robust Decision Making methods to address two questions applied to investment decisions at the Port of Los Angeles: (1) Under what future conditions would a Port of Los Angeles decision to harden its facilities against extreme flood scenarios at the next upgrade pass a cost-benefit test, and (2) Do sea-level rise projections and other information suggest such conditions are sufficiently likely to justify such an investment? We also compare and contrast the Robust Decision Making methods with a full probabilistic analysis. These two analysis frameworks result in similar investment recommendations for different idealized future sea-level projections, but provide different information to decision makers and envision different types of engagement with stakeholders. In particular, the full probabilistic analysis begins by aggregating the best scientific information into a single set of joint probability distributions, while the Robust Decision Making analysis identifies scenarios where a decision to invest in near-term response to extreme sea-level rise passes a cost-benefit test, and then assembles scientific information of differing levels of confidence to help decision makers judge whether or not these scenarios are sufficiently likely to justify making such investments. Results highlight the highly-localized and context dependent nature of applying Robust Decision Making methods to inform investment decisions.",,,,302.0

It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, 2 which concluded that anthropogenic climate change threatens to undermine the past 50 years of gains in public health, and conversely, that a comprehensive response to climate change could be ""the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"". The Lancet Countdown is a collaboration between 24 academic institutions and intergovernmental organisations based in every continent and with representation from a wide range of disciplines. The collaboration includes climate scientists, ecologists, economists, engineers, experts in energy, food, and transport systems, geographers, mathematicians, social and political scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. It reports annual indicators across five sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement.

455,Collaborative Governance for Climate Change Adaptation: Mapping citizen-municipality interactions,,2018-01-01,"Increasing climate change impacts are a major threat to sustainable urban development, and challenge current governance structures, including actors' responsibilities for dealing with climate variability and extremes. The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing adaptation interactions' and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens - to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk - requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and responsibilisation'; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. (c) 2017 The Authors.

456,Climate change impacts on natural resources and communities: A geospatial approach for management,,2018-01-01,"Climate change causes environmental depletion, with threats to the global economy. The health and productivity of ecosystems underpin agriculture, with stable ecosystems being the foundation for economic livelihoods and food security. This study proposes adaptation measures, using geospatial technology, for conserving natural resources and improving livelihoods of the local community from climate change scenarios. Planning, policy decisions and resultant programmes are required for natural resource management, which must be based on broad citizen participation and the engagement of rural communities. The suggested adaptation measures will help the planning system to regulate development of natural resources and the socio-economic environment. The major natural resources in the environment are land and water, both of which can be severely degraded by human interventions, as well as climate change. Various thematic maps are prepared with the use of geospatial technology, in order to be helpful for site-suitability analysis directed to the preparation of land and water management action plans for socio-economic development. The study area is a micro-watershed of the catchment of Ansupa Lake in the Cuttack District of Odisha, India. To reduce climate change impacts on natural resources and economic livelihoods, some adaptation measures have been proposed (e.g., 68.9ha for afforestation.; 13.94ha for gap plantations and agro-horticulture; 389.62ha for farm ponds and renovation of existing ponds for pisciculture and duckery activities, etc.; 11.33ha for land management, along with five bore wells, eight dug wells, 51 LBS/check dams, and four WHSs, etc., for water management for sustainable use).",,,,244.0
457,"National guidance for adapting to coastal hazards and sea-level rise: Anticipating change, when and how to change pathway",,2018-01-01,"Sea-level rise challenges public policy-making because existing planning frameworks and methods are designed to promote certainty using static and time-bound planning and legal instruments. Sea-level rise is a dynamic and uncertain process, which is deeply uncertain towards the latter part of this century and beyond. Communities require decision making approaches that can enable adjustments to policies ahead of damage, without entrenching current exposure to hazards or incurring larger than necessary adjustment costs in the future. We first discuss the nature of the sea-level problem, the policy context that creates decision-making challenges and how they have been typically addressed through policy and practice. Secondly, we show how an assessment and planning approach, designed to address uncertainty and change (the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) planning approach), has been integrated into national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change decision making in New Zealand. The Guidance integrates hazard and sea-level rise assessments with uncertainty type and with the scale and scope of activity. It is underpinned with values-based community engagement, and uses signals and decision triggers for monitoring and adjusting pathways to meet objectives over time. The applicability of the approach in the Guidance for other policy problems involving uncertainty, is also discussed.",,,,201.0

This study explores how maps may address these challenges to sea level rise communication by making visible the impacts of sea level rise on local communities. Using an interactive map of sea level rise in Sarasota, Florida and an accompanying online survey, it considers how college students from nearby and far away from Sarasota, and with different views about climate change, vary in their risk perceptions. Results show that, consistent with spatial optimism bias, risk perceptions increased more from pre- to post map for respondents far away from Sarasota than for those nearby, while respondents who were initially doubtful or cautious about climate change showed larger increases in risk perceptions than those who were disengaged or alarmed.",,,,147.0

460,Adaptive and interactive climate futures: systematic review of 'serious games' for engagement and decision-making,,2018-01-01,"Climate change is already having adverse impacts on ecosystems, communities and economic activities through higher temperatures, prolonged droughts, and more frequent extremes. However, a gap remains between public understanding, scientific knowledge about climate change, and changes in behaviour to effect adaptation. 'Serious games'-games used for purposes other than entertainment-are one way to reduce this adaptation deficit by enhancing opportunities for social learning and enabling positive action. Games can provide communities with the opportunity to interactively explore different climate futures, build capability and capacity for dealing with complex challenges, and socialise adaptation priorities with diverse publics. Using systematic review methods, this paper identifies, reviews, synthesises and assesses the literature on serious games for climate change adaptation. To determine where and how impact is achieved, we draw on an evaluation framework grounded in social learning, to assess which combinations of cognitive (knowledge and thinking), normative (norms and approaches) and relational (how people connect and network building) learning are achieved. Results show that factors influencing the overall success in influencing behaviour and catalysing learning for adaptation include generating high levels of interand intra-level trust between researchers, practitioners and community participants; strong debriefing and evaluation practices; and the use of experienced and knowledgeable facilitators. These results can help inform future game design, and research methodologies to develop robust ways for engaging with stakeholders and end users, and enhance learning effects for resilient climate futures.",,,,230.0
461,Business attitudes towards funding ecosystem services provided by urban forests,,2018-01-01,"Urban trees and woodlands provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) to society, for example, flood risk reduction, air purification, and moderation of urban heat islands. Despite this, local government budgets for tree planting and maintenance have declined in many cities throughout the world. Thus far, the academic literature has largely ignored whether businesses are willing to help fund urban forests and the ES they provide. Business financing via payments for ecosystem services (PES) within the urban realm is also under-researched and lacking in practice. This study aims to address these research gaps. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 30 businesses of varying sizes and sectors, operating in Southampton, UK. Respondents thought a public-private partnership would be feasible, with a focus on voluntary payments towards enhancing air quality, reducing flood risk, and improving aesthetics. Respondents would prefer to choose from a list of location-specific, cost-effective, monitored projects to fund directly, for marketing and/or corporate social responsibility purposes. To facilitate business funding of urban forest-based ES, clear communication of the expected environmental benefits and a strong business case are required, drawing on the experience of similar initiatives. From our findings, we recommend the piloting and analysis of such PES schemes.",,,,200.0
462,Attaining urban water sustainability in Hong Kong: Three suggestions,,2018-01-01,"Over several decades, Hong Kong has implemented a number of technological innovations for securing its water supply. But as population growth and the effects of climate change put pressure on existing water sources, new innovations combined with social adaptations will be required. This commentary offers three suggestions for moving toward urban water sustainability in Hong Kong. The suggestions are: diversify sources of water while minimising dependence on desalination, foster public engagement with water and implement water-sensitive urban design. These suggestions are not intended to be a panacea but to augment existing measures that when combined can move toward the attainment of urban water sustainability.",,,,104.0
463,"An Assessment of the Relationships between Extreme Weather Events, Vulnerability, and the Impacts on Human Wellbeing in Latin America",,2018-01-01,"Climate change and variability are known to have an influence on human wellbeing in a variety of ways. In Latin America, such forces are especially conspicuous, particularly in respect of extreme climatological, hydrological, and weather events (EWEs) and climate-sensitive disasters (CSDs). Consistent with the need to study further such connections, this paper presents an analysis of some of the vulnerabilities of environmental health issues and climate-related impacts that are focusing on EWEs and CSDs in Latin American countries. The research includes an analysis of the (i) human and socio-economic development; (ii) geographical and socio-economic determinants of vulnerability and adaptability of environmental health issues (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity); (iii) occurrence of CSDs from 1988 to 2017 and their direct impacts on human wellbeing (Total death and Affected people); (iv) an online survey on the perceptions of the effects of EWEs on human wellbeing in a sample of countries in the region; and (v) discussion of possible solutions. The socio-economic and development indices, and the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) and Climate-Risk Index (CRI) disaster statistics suggest that the impacts of CSDs are primarily related to socio-economic determinants of human wellbeing and health inequalities. Also, >80% respondents to the survey say that the leading causes of climate-related human impacts are the lack of (i) public awareness; (ii) investment and (iii) preparedness. The paper concludes by adding some suggestions that show how countries in Latin America may better cope with the impacts of Climate-sensitive Disasters.",,,,242.0
464,Psychosocial drivers for change: Understanding and promoting stakeholder engagement in local adaptation to climate change in three European Mediterranean case studies,,2018-01-01,"Stakeholder engagement in the processes of planning local adaptation to climate change faces many challenges. The goal of this work was to explore whether or not the intention of engaging could be understood (Study 1) and promoted (Study 2), by using an extension of the theory of planned behaviour. In Study 1, stakeholders from three European Mediterranean case studies were surveyed: Baixo Vouga Lagunar (Portugal), SCOT Provence Mediterranee (France), and the island of Crete (Greece) (N = 115). Stakeholders' intention of engaging was significantly predicted by subjective norm (which was predicted by injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and stakeholders) and by perceived behavioural control (which was predicted by knowledge of policy and instruments). Study 2 was conducted in the Baixo Vouga Lagunar case study and consisted of a two-workshop intervention where issues on local and regional adaptation, policies, and engagement were presented and discussed. A within-participants comparison of initial survey results with results following the workshops (N-T1 = 12, N-T2 = 15, N-T3 = 12) indicated that these were successful in increasing stakeholders' intention of engaging. This increase was paired with a) an increase in injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and consequently in subjective norm, and to b) a decrease in perceived complexity of planning local adaptation and an increase in knowledge regarding adaptation to climate change.",,,,217.0
465,Enhancing Climate Change Research With Open Science,,2018-01-01,"Climate change research aims to understand global environmental change and how it will impact nature and society. The broad scope of climate change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018), individual data ownership (Hampton et al., 2015), and inefficient research workflows (Lowndes et al., 2017). Furthermore, the level of public interest and policy engagement on climate change issues relies on fast communication of academic research to public institutions, with the result that the societal impact of climate change studies will differ according to their public availability and exposure. Here, we argue that by adopting open science (OS) principles, scientists can advance climate change research and accelerate efforts to mitigate impacts; especially for highly vulnerable developing regions of the world where research capacity is limited. We underscore the specific benefits of OS in raising the academic and societal impact of climate change research using citation and media metrics.",,,,207.0
466,From network to meshwork: Becoming attuned to difference in transdisciplinary environmental research encounters,,2018-01-01,"Transdisciplinary research has been promoted as a means of bringing together certified experts and stakeholders to produce knowledge that is policy-relevant, salient, credible, and legitimate to inform decision-making about complex problems. In this article I discuss the limitations of using the 'network' metaphor in transdisciplinary research practice and propose the use of a different metaphor to make transdisciplinary research encounters more attuned to difference. This research is informed by Tim Ingold's use of 'meshwork' as a metaphor for how life is lived along lines of becoming: emergent, indeterminate, contingent, historical, narrative. In this paper, my objective is to explain and illustrate by way of an example of a transdisciplinary climate change adaptation project the need for a new metaphor to convey the open-endedness of transdisciplinary research where subject positions are not conceived in advance of a research encounter, such as in the 'network' metaphor, but erupt in the interstices of research methods, objectives and desired outcomes. The meshwork metaphor implies that transdisciplinarity should be reframed as a practice of attunement to difference, becoming skilled in paying attention, witnessing, and responding to differences.",,,,182.0
467,Towards a climate change adaptation strategy for national parks: Adaptive management pathways under dynamic risk,,2018-01-01,"Government seeks to manage public protected areas, such as national parks, to conserve high-quality wildlife habitats and provide essential ecosystems services at risk of permanent damage or extinction from climate change. The complexity of the organizational structure required to deliver this breadth of functions, coupled to uncertainty surrounding the onset and severity of climate impacts at local scale, impedes planning for climate change. This paper describes the development of an adaptation planning tool and its application in a pilot planning process for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the agency of the New South Wales (NSW) Government (Australia) responsible for management of national parks and public conservation reserves. The process involved close engagement in knowledge co-production in participatory workshops, and employed two complementary techniques, adaptive pathways and risk assessment. It successfully elicited tacit knowledge of agency staff about the range of interventions available, the need for management practices to evolve, and of discontinuities in management pathways in a dynamic risk environment. Findings suggest that management effort across the NSW reserve system will increase as climate risk rises. Consequently, government will need to respond to increased demand for resources, for better targeting of those resources, and for management innovation in how resources are deployed to support adaptation that is both anticipatory and transformative.",,,,212.0
468,An institutional analysis to address climate change adaptation in Tenerife (Canary Islands),,2018-01-01,"Heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks have been acquiring more frequency and intensity in the Canary Islands during the last decades. Both climatic hazards are known to produce impacts on human health such as mortality (due to heat waves) and morbidity (due to dusty weather). This work addresses possible climate adaptation policies in Tenerife assuming the increasing impact of heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks in the island under a climate change scenario. It explores the institutional setting of climate change adaptation planning in Tenerife and evaluates the statu quo of adaptation planning in the island through the engagement of key social actors. An historical review of the local and regional press articles and legislation, an in-depth round of interviews, together with questionnaires to the main social actors allows framing the social and political context in which climate change adaptation in Tenerife is embedded. Key social actors were engaged, including international organisations, atmospheric research centres, local Universities, regional and insular governments, trade unions, and environmental NGOs, among others. The main obstacles mentioned by the social actors that hinder the development of an effective climate adaptation policy address scientific knowledge, data collection and policy making, focusing on the uncertainty of climate models, the lack of epidemiological data and contrasting opinions regarding the existing climate adaptation policies. Public participation, mainstreaming of climate policies and an integrated approach between mitigation and adaptation plans were identified as key policy issues. The outcomes of this study could be meaningful for climate adaptation initiatives at local or regional level, such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, that intend to promote climate resilience through the setup of climate adaptation strategies and plans at municipality level.",,,,278.0
469,"Experiential climate change education: Challenges of conducting mixed-methods, interdisciplinary research in San Juan Islands, WA and Oakland, CA",,2018-01-01,"Transitioning food, energy and water systems for adaptation and mitigation of climate change is a challenge requiring social as well as technological solutions. The best technological solutions will only be effective if combined with behavior changes placing climate change at the forefront of our socio-cultural consciousness. Education is central in creating such a shift. Climate researchers have an important role in aiding the uptake of climate change education in U.S. public schools, where educators are often untrained and uncomfortable teaching the subject. This paper assesses the efficacy of implementing an interdisciplinary, experiential climate change curriculum in school garden classrooms in terms of student climate literacy and teacher professional development. The questions of how to teach and research climate education are explored via a participatory research project with schools in Oakland, CA and Lopez Island, WA. Initial results show improvement in student learning and engagement as well as teacher preparation. Both qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed through student surveys, teacher interviews, and site observation; however, further qualitative methodologies to study process of climate and energy literacy development are needed. Specifically, this paper argues for new forms of assessment to capture dimensions of climate literacy including knowledge, engagement, and behavior change.",,,,200.0
470,The MJA-Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: Australian policy inaction threatens lives,,2018-01-01,"Climate plays an important role in human health and it is well established that climate change can have very significant impacts in this regard. In partnership with The Lancet and the MJA, we present the inaugural Australian Countdown assessment of progress on climate change and health. This comprehensive assessment examines 41 indicators across five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. These indicators and the methods used for each are largely consistent with those of the Lancet Countdown global assessment published in October 2017, but with an Australian focus. Significant developments include the addition of a new indicator on mental health. Overall, we find that Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In a number of respects, Australia has gone backwards and now lags behind other high income countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom. Examples include the persistence of a very high carbon-intensive energy system in Australia, and its slow transition to renewables and low carbon electricity generation. However, we also find some examples of good progress, such as heatwave response planning. Given the overall poor state of progress on climate change and health in Australia, this country now has an enormous opportunity to take action and protect human health and lives. Australia has the technical knowhow and intellect to do this, and our annual updates of this assessment will track Australia's engagement with and progress on this vitally important issue.",,,,267.0
471,Mapping Discourses of Climate Change Adaptation in the United Kingdom,,2019-01-01,"The concept of adaptation is becoming part of mainstream public discourse on climate change. Yet the diversity, complexity, and novelty of the adaptation concept itself leads to interpretive flexibility, differing public understanding of (and engagement with) adaptation strategies, and hence differentiated policy responses. The boundary work of communicative practices and public understanding of the adaptation concept therefore requires empirical analysis in different cases and contexts. This study employs Q-methodology (a combined quantitative-qualitative social research method) to reveal the typologies of perspectives that emerge around the adaptation concept among a diverse group of citizen-stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Four such typologies are identified under the labels 1) top-down climate action, 2) collective action on climate change, 3) optimistic, values-focused adaptation, and 4) adaptation skepticism. The division between these perspectives reveals a perceived responsibility gap between the governmental-institutional and/or individual-community levels. Across the emergent discourses we find a consensual call for a multisector, multiscalar, and multistakeholder-led approach that posits adaptation as a contemporary, intragenerational problem, with a strong emphasis upon managing extreme weather events, and not as an abstract future problem. By attending to these public discourses in climate policy, this presents a potential means to lessen such a responsibility gap.",,,,199.0

Such organizations have a complex role: engaging with policy-makers, as well as their memberships and the public, to pursue the interests of their specific communities. This paper includes an examination of how farm producer organizations communicate about climate and weather to these various audiences, and the specific needs and recommendations they advance. Of particular interest are commodities related to pasture-based grazing, which is underrepresented in the climate adaptation literature. A collection of",,,,99.0

474,Assessing the Capacity to Govern Flood Risk in Cities and the Role of Contextual Factors,,2018-01-01,"Sea level rise and increased storm events urge cities to develop governance capacity. However, a cohesive conceptual and empirical-based understanding of what governance capacity implies, how to measure it, and what cities can learn, is largely lacking. Understanding the influence of context is critical to address this issue. Accordingly, we aim to identify crosscutting contextual factors and how they prioritise different elements of governance capacity to address urban flood risk. In doing so, a framework of nine conditions and 27 indicators is applied in two Dutch cities and two cities in the United Kingdom. Three crosscutting contextual factors are identified that may explain differences in capacity-development priorities: (1) flood probability and impact; (2) national imposed institutional setting; and, (3) level of authority to secure long-term financial support. Capacity-priorities include, the recent political devolution in the UK, which emphasizes the role of citizen awareness, stakeholder engagement, entrepreneurial agents, and the overall necessity for local capacity-development. The Dutch focus on flood safety through centralised public coordination reduces flood probability but inhibits incentives to reduce flood impacts and lowers public awareness. In conclusion, the three identified contextual factors enable a better understanding of capacity-building priorities and may facilitate learning between cities.",,,,198.0
475,Effectiveness of gaming for communicating and teaching climate change,,2018-01-01,"Games are increasingly proposed as an innovative way to convey scientific insights on the climate-economic system to students, non-experts, and the wider public. Yet, it is not clear if games can meet such expectations. We present quantitative evidence on the effectiveness of a simulation game for communicating and teaching international climate politics. We use a sample of over 200 students from Germany playing the simulation game KEEP COOL. We combine pre- and postgame surveys on climate politics with data on individual in-game decisions. Our key findings are that gaming increases the sense of personal responsibility, the confidence in politics for climate change mitigation, and makes more optimistic about international cooperation in climate politics. Furthermore, players that do cooperate less in the game become more optimistic about international cooperation but less confident about politics. These results are relevant for the design of future games, showing that effective climate games do not require climate-friendly in-game behavior as a winning condition. We conclude that simulation games can facilitate experiential learning about the difficulties of international climate politics and thereby complement both conventional communication and teaching methods.",,,,183.0
476,A new framework to analyse workforce contribution to Australian cotton farm adaptability,,2018-01-01,"Farmers face many challenges, including climate variability, that require continual adaptation. However, studies of farm adaptation have paid limited attention to the farm workforce, despite changes in farm workforce organisation (i.e. the number, type and forms of employment on farm) being a significant feature of agricultural change globally. To effectively support farmers' adaptation, it is important to understand farmers' workforce strategies (i.e. how farm workforce organisation supports the needs and priorities of the farm), how workforce choices are made and the implications for adaptation. This paper progresses a framework for analysing farm adaptability, including the farm workforce. Bringing together theories of livelihoods analysis and strategic human resource management, the farm workforce strategies of 16 case study farms in the Australian cotton production sector are analysed. Cotton production is exposed to major resource constraints, such as irrigation water. We interviewed farmers and collected data on farm business performance, workforce organisation choices, human resource management practices and employees' experiences of work. We integrated data to characterise farm workforce decision-making and the relationship between workforce strategies and farm adaptability for each farm. A cross-case analysis explored differences between farms. A diversity of workforce strategies was found, involving combinations of workforce options, defined as 'core', 'contract' and 'casual' workers at different levels of skills and experience. Farm workforce strategies were found to influence and be influenced by sources of financial capital, irrigation water availability/holdings, farm remoteness, new farm infrastructure and human resource management practices. The farm workforce was a response option to provide production flexibility, yet high adaptability was associated with some negative consequences for managers and employees. We show for the first time the influence of farm workforce organisation dynamics in adaptation and negative consequences of high farm adaptability. 'Factoring-in' the farm workforce in sustainable development studies should therefore be a priority.",,,,299.0

Using survey and secondary data this study investigates the potential of metropolitan planning organizations to play a formative role in climate change action and policy. We examine factors that promote MPOs involvement in climate change issues by bridging two types of literatures in a quantitative modeling framework: the institutional responses to environmental change, driven by conceptualization of urban systems as social-ecological systems, and the public policy, regional planning and local politics literature. We find robust MPOs, capacity and the organization members' mental models play significant predictors for MPOs engagement in activities directly or indirectly related to climate change.",,,,122.0
478,"Using Future Scenario Planning as a tool for informed decision making on infrastructure interventions in Kibera, Nairobi in Kenya",,2018-01-01,"This paper focuses on the use of Future Scenario Planning and an adaptation of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework as analysis tools for informed decision-making in a community workshop. The aim of this methodology was to assess the perceived impacts of two infrastructure interventions for flood mitigation (local drainage improvement and local flood protection by gabions along the river edges) in the Andolo community in Kibera, Nairobi, in Kenya. Future Scenario Planning was used as a visualisation method for the changes each intervention could bring to the community and the perceived impacts were measured using the assets component of the British Department for International Development (DFID)'s Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. The exercise was delivered as a two-day workshop, which ensured community engagement and facilitated co-decision making of an infrastructure intervention. The process was helpful to ensure sustainability in the use and maintenance of a public space, as well as for initiating conversations within the community regarding critical infrastructure and prioritisation of interventions for mitigating immediate risks.",,,,164.0
479,Mapping Out Climate Change: Assessing How Coastal Communities Adapt Using Alternative Future Scenarios,,2018-01-01,"Coastal communities are increasingly experiencing climate change-induced coastal disasters and chronic flooding and erosion. Decision makers and the public alike are struggling to reconcile the lack of ""fit"" between a rapidly changing environment and relatively rigid governance structures. In efforts to bridge this environment-governance gap in Tillamook County, Oregon, stakeholders formed a knowledge-to-action network (KTAN). The KTAN examined alternative future coastal policy and climate scenarios through extensive stakeholder engagement and the spatially explicit agent-based modeling framework Envision. The KTAN's results were further evaluated through a two-step mixed methods approach. First, KTAN-identified metrics were quantitatively assessed and compared under present-day vs. alternative policy scenarios. Second, the feasibility of implementing these policy scenarios was qualitatively evaluated through a review of governmental regulations and semistructured interviews. The findings show that alternative policy scenarios ranged from significantly beneficial to extremely harmful to coastal buildings and beach accessibility in comparison to present-day policies, and they were relatively feasible to almost impossible to implement. Beneficial policies that lower impacts of flooding and erosion clearly diverge from the existing regulatory environment, which inhibits their implementation. In response, leadership and cross-sector cooperation and coordination can help to overcome mixed interests and motivations, and increase information exchange between and within the public and government organizations. The combination of stakeholder engagement, an alternative futures modeling framework, and the robust quantitative and qualitative evaluation of policy scenarios provides a powerful model for coastal communities hoping to adapt to climate change along any coastline.",,,,242.0
480,Insurance engagement in flood risk reduction - examples from household and business insurance in developed countries,,2018-01-01,"Insurance can be an important mechanism to stimulate flood risk reduction and thus decrease losses. However, there is a gap between the theoretical potential described by academic scholars and the actual engagement of insurers. In the analysis, I have collected examples of insurers' engagement in flood risk reduction, focusing on household and business insurance in developed countries. Insurers engaged either directly, e.g., through co-financing risk reduction, or more indirectly by giving incentives to policyholders or governmental actors to adopt risk reduction measures. I analyzed their engagement with the framing conditions of the market they were acting in, such as market penetration or private or public insurance schemes. I found risk reduction measures like awareness-raising campaigns targeting citizens to be quite common across several countries. There was less insurance engagement in risk reduction measures such as warning or land-use planning, which are perceived to be mainly governmental tasks. The use of risk-based pricing as an incentive for the adoption of risk reduction measures as suggested by academia is difficult in practice, due to barriers such as information gaps on the effectiveness of property-level protection measures and requirements concerning the affordability of insurance. New approaches to overcome these shortfalls include organized data collection on property-level protection measures or the insurance of high-risks for affordable premiums in public-private partnership constellations with the government.",,,,220.0
481,Who Should Pay for Climate Adaptation? Public Attitudes and the Financing of Flood Protection in Florida,,2018-01-01,"An investigation of public support for coastal adaptation options and public finance options in Florida evaluated stakeholder judgments and how they changed through a participatory engagement process. The study found that public finance mechanisms that imposed fiscal burdens on those who directly benefit from hazard reduction were rated as more acceptable than others. Significantly, visualisations and data on local economic damage and return on investment of potential adaptation options further increased acceptability ratings. The question of whether a development fee for adaptation or any other public purpose supported by private funds is a legal issue that depends on a test called the rational nexus. One concern of this article is to explore options for such fees to cover adaptation to climate change. This raises issues about the potential conflict with the community-wide and intergenerational nature of long-term adaptation. We also explore the relevance of environmental attitudes using the 'new environmental paradigm' (NEP) scale and political party affiliation. Results have implications for infrastructure improvements that require public approval for financing.",,,,169.0
482,Beyond Threshold Approaches to Extreme Heat: Repositioning Adaptation as Everyday Practice,,2018-01-01,"One of climate change's most certain impacts is increasingly frequent and extreme heat. Heat management and climate adaptation policies generally utilize temperature and humidity thresholds to identify what constitute extreme conditions. In the workplace, such thresholds can be used to trigger reductions in work intensity and/or duration. In regions that routinely exceed proposed thresholds, however, this approach can be deeply problematic and raises critical questions about how frequently exposed populations already manage and mitigate the effects of extreme heat. Drawing on social practice theories, this paper repositions everyday engagements with extreme heat in terms of practices of work. It finds that bodies absorb and produce heat through practices, challenging the view that extreme heat is an external risk to which bodies are exposed. This theoretical starting point also challenges the utility of threshold-based adaptation strategies by demonstrating how heat is actively coproduced by living, performing bodies in weather. This argument is exemplified through a case study of outdoor, manual workers in Australia's monsoon tropics, where work practices were adapted to reduce thermal load. More specifically, we find that workers weather work and work the weather to enable work to be done in extreme conditions. Our analysis of everyday heat adaptation draws attention to the generative capacities of bodies and unsettles two established separations: 1) that between climatic exposure and sensitivity, calling for a more embodied, experiential, and performed perspective and 2) that between climatic impacts and (mal)adaptation, calling for an understanding of climate adaptation, as located in everyday practices, in the management of bodies in weather.",,,,256.0
483,Typologies of citizen co-production in flood risk governance,,2018-01-01,"Citizens in Europe are increasingly being encouraged by policymakers to contribute to flood risk governance (FRG) by taking individual and/or community-based flood risk measures (e.g. implementing property-level measures). This trend might be described as a transition towards 'co-produced' FRG between public authorities and citizens. The co-production trend is mirrored in literature, with an increasing number of publications discussing citizen involvement in the implementation of FRG. Still, this research is in its infancy and requires more systematic insight into the prevalence, success factors and side effects of co-produced FRG. This article contributes to this endeavour by looking across disciplinary boundaries to critically examine the extent to which co-production types identified in other policy domains match the diversity of co-production forms witnessed in FRG. Taking this co-production literature as a starting point, the authors assemble three typologies to capture the different forms of co-production witnessed in FRG. In order to do so, examples of FRG co-production were identified in England (UK), Flanders (Belgium), France, the Netherlands and Poland, through document analysis and in-depth interviews. These examples were used to test and redevelop co-production typologies described in literature. The resulting typologies concentrate on the i) type of interaction, ii) the role and type of citizen input and iii) the distribution of contributions and benefits. These frameworks have the potential to not only serve as important heuristic devices for future empirical research, but may also facilitate more reflexive governance in practice.",,,,237.0
484,UK public perceptions of Ocean Acidification - The importance of place and environmental identity,,2018-01-01,"The marine environment is affected by climate change in many ways but it is also affected by the separate problem of ocean acidification (OA). Anthropogenic carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the ocean causes changes in ocean chemistry including an increase in acidity. Fisheries and shellfish industries, which are vital livelihoods for some communities have already been affected by OA. As there has been little research conducted to examine public risk perceptions of this issue, the aim was to explore this through a survey (N = 954) carried out in the UK. The survey explored a range of psychological factors including concern, place attachment, and environmental identity that are known to influence risk perceptions. A regression analysis found that more concerned participants had stronger environmental identities and higher levels of knowledge about OA. As predicted, they also felt more attached to the ocean and felt more negative about OA. It was clear that place attachment and environmental identity were important factors and thus should not be neglected when developing risk communications, particularly for this unfamiliar risk issue. As unfamiliar and complex risks such as OA are becoming more prevalent and must be communicated successfully in a world full of conflicting information, it is important to consider how OA is perceived by the public and how this can inform policy decisions in future. If major mitigation and adaptation strategies are adopted by policymakers the success of these will also ultimately require society to accept them.",,,,244.0
485,A discursive-institutional perspective on transformative governance: A case from a fire management policy sector,,2018-01-01,"Scholarship around questions of climate change adaptation is increasingly concerned with ideas of transformative adaptation and its governance through critical re-evaluation of beliefs, values and associated institutions. For public policy sectors, the concept of transformative governance brings attention to their capacities for supporting and engaging in such governance. While much adaptation research and practice informs technical and structural understandings of these capacities (e.g., governance arrangements, learning systems and adaptation planning), most of this research (and practice) has ignored less formal, yet equally important dimensions of public administration and governance. Institutional scholarship highlights that dominant norms, beliefs, and philosophical ideas underpin how policy sectors structure their policy responses and engagement in governance. Discursive Institutionalism suggests that examining a sector's dominant discourse can provide insights into these institutional logics. This paper therefore argues that understanding a policy sector's institutional logics is a crucial part of working toward enabling transformative governance of adaptation. This argument is developed through a case study of the institutional logics operating in the fire management policy sector of Victoria, Australia, and the potential influence of these logics on that sector's capacities to engage in transformative governance. Findings suggest this sector's institutional logics may currently constrain its capacities to engage in transformative governance and highlight the need for greater attention to socioinstitutional dimensions of public administration to help catalyze transformative governance of (and for) adaptation.",,,,226.0
