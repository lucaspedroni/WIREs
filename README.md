# Introduction

These are the materials comprising the scientometric analysis in _Engaging Citizens: A Review of Citizen Participation Strategies
for Climate Change Adaptation Since the Rio Earth Summit_. In order to re-create the analysis, you'll need to install the following Python packages, using Python **3.7.x**:

# Analysis

When you've installed the packages, run `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`. The primary analysis is contained in [WIREs.ipynb](WIREs.ipynb). A plaintext version of the dataset, derived from an ISI Web of Science search, can be found at [CCA_processed.csv](CCA_processed.csv)
