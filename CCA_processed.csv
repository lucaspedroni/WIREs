0,Adaptation to Coastal Storms in Atlantic Canada: Implications and Lessons Learned,2018-01-01,"In order to improve the resilience of social-ecological systems of small rural coastal communities in Atlantic Canada, we used different methodologies to not only increase awareness and understanding of what is climate change, but also to enhance public engagement and find solutions that are more appropriate to these communities. This entailed, for example, integrating scientific and existing knowledge. Communities need to be a part of planning and governance in order to identify the most important impacts and response measures. Local governance, from local service districts to municipal and support from the provincial government, are also considered essential in order to improve resilience in the study region. It is necessary to have both short-term (emergency) plans in effect as well as longer term planning for improved adaptation to increasing major storms. Adaptation measures have to consider any physicosocial aspects of hazards, with social responses integrated into physical and environmental hazard-proofing initiatives. Other suggestions are included here based on lessons learned from the research.",162,order improve resilience social ecological system small rural coastal community atlantic canada used different methodology increase awareness understanding enhance find solution appropriate community entailed example integrating scientific existing knowledge community need part planning governance order identify important impact response measure local governance local service district municipal support provincial government considered essential order improve resilience region necessary short term emergency plan effect well longer term planning improved increasing major storm measure consider physicosocial aspect hazard social response integrated physical environmental hazard proofing initiative suggestion included based lesson learned research
1,Adaptation to Coastal Storms in Atlantic Canada: Methodology,2018-01-01,"In this chapter, we describe the methodological approach that was selected in order to better understand how communities affected by interventions on climate change adaptation change over time and whether these interventions were effective or not. The project was based on two main elements: a longitudinal study and participatory action research (PAR). The main goal of the longitudinal component of the project was to examine changes over time, while PAR aimed to co-produce knowledge and co-construct solutions with the communities. This was important in order to consider existing knowledge with scientific knowledge for more socially acceptable solutions. To do so, different tools were employed in the communities, depending on their interests and the issues that the communities wanted to work on in priority.",123,chapter describe methodological approach selected order better understand community affected intervention time whether intervention effective project based main element longitudinal participatory action research par main goal longitudinal component project examine change time par aimed co produce knowledge co construct solution community important order consider existing knowledge scientific knowledge socially acceptable solution different tool employed community depending interest issue community wanted work priority
2,"A regional, multi-sectoral and integrated assessment of the impacts of climate and socio-economic change in the UK",2005-01-01,"The 'Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West England' (RegIS) integrated assessment (IA) investigated climate and socio-economic impacts and adaptation options, and cross-sectoral interactions between four major sectors driving landscape change (agriculture, biodiversity, coastal zones and water resources). The baseline and two contrasting climate change scenarios (with and without regional socio-economic change scenarios) were investigated. RegIS showed that climate change, without policy adaptation, could lead to severe flood impacts in East Anglia, and significant agricultural abandonment. Despite yield changes, cropping is generally insensitive to climate, but very sensitive to socio-economic change. There is increased seasonality to river flows, compounded by increased urbanisation and irrigation demand. The responses of biodiversity to climate change are regional, habitat and species-specific, but much of the future of biodiversity in these regions will depend on planned adaptation in the other sectors. Numerous examples of public engagement with the global change sphere represent the real outward value of RegIS, due to the significant uncertainties and limitations to knowledge in this first regional IA which prevented results of the detail, specificity and confidence that decision-makers required. However, with further investment and refinement, regional IA's will increasingly provide such output.",198,regional impact response study east anglia north west england regis integrated assessment ia investigated socio economic impact option cross sectoral interaction four major sector driving landscape agriculture biodiversity coastal zone water resource baseline contrasting scenario without regional socio economic scenario investigated regis showed without policy could lead severe flood impact east anglia significant agricultural abandonment despite yield change cropping generally insensitive sensitive socio economic increased seasonality river flow compounded increased urbanisation irrigation demand response biodiversity regional habitat specie specific much future biodiversity region depend planned sector numerous example global sphere represent real outward value regis due significant uncertainty limitation knowledge first regional ia prevented result detail specificity confidence decision maker required however investment refinement regional ia increasingly provide output
3,Bridging the gap: empowering decision-making for adaptation through the,2006-01-01,"The methods, tools and outputs of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) show how building adaptive capacity to climate change can be embedded within a wide range of organizations. UKCIP has been operating since 1997 to support decision-makers' assessments of their vulnerability to climate change so that they can plan how to adapt. Whilst stakeholder engagement is now generally regarded as vital to ensure that research meets the needs of decision-makers for information, this usually means that stakeholders are positioned in a 'consultative' role in research. In contrast, the UKCIP aims to bridge the gap between research and policy so that decision-makers take control to produce research in ways that are useful to them. The Programme has been flexible and was developed incrementally, with increased scientific understanding, taking advantage of collaborative funding and facilitating long-standing partnerships. Whilst the core framework of scenarios and tools has been developed centrally, most studies have been stakeholder-funded and led. The Programme's results suggest that if decision-makers are supported, capacity is built for assessments, and crucially, research outputs are directly applicable to their ongoing work and strategic planning. This capacity-building has worked across scales and sectors and is an effective route to mainstreaming climate change adaptation. The implication, therefore, is that more support should be given by funding agencies to develop institutional capacity to support adaptation to climate change in both the private and public sectors.",231,method tool output uk impact programme ukcip building adaptive capacity embedded within wide range organization ukcip operating since support decision maker assessment vulnerability plan adapt whilst stakeholder generally regarded vital ensure research meet need decision maker information usually mean stakeholder positioned consultative role research contrast ukcip aim bridge gap research policy decision maker take control produce research way useful programme flexible developed incrementally increased scientific understanding taking advantage collaborative funding facilitating long standing partnership whilst core framework scenario tool developed centrally study stakeholder funded led programme result suggest decision maker supported capacity built assessment crucially research output directly applicable ongoing work strategic planning capacity building worked across scale sector effective route mainstreaming implication therefore support given funding agency develop institutional capacity support private sector
4,The Value of Linking Mitigation and Adaptation: A Case Study of Bangladesh,2009-01-01,"There are two principal strategies for managing climate change risks: mitigation and adaptation. Until recently, mitigation and adaptation have been considered separately in both climate change science and policy. Mitigation has been treated as an issue for developed countries, which hold the greatest responsibility for climate change, while adaptation is seen as a priority for the South, where mitigative capacity is low and vulnerability is high. This conceptual divide has hindered progress against the achievement of the fundamental sustainable development challenges of climate change. Recent attention to exploring the synergies between mitigation and adaptation suggests that an integrated approach could go some way to bridging the gap between the development and adaptation priorities of the South and the need to achieve global engagement in mitigation. These issues are explored through a case study analysis of climate change policy and practice in Bangladesh. Using the example of waste-to-compost projects, a mitigation-adaptation-development nexus is demonstrated, as projects contribute to mitigation through reducing methane emissions; adaptation through soil improvement in drought-prone areas; and sustainable development, because poverty is exacerbated when climate change reduces the flows of ecosystem services. Further, linking adaptation to mitigation makes mitigation action more relevant to policymakers in Bangladesh, increasing engagement in the international climate change agenda in preparation for a post-Kyoto global strategy. This case study strengthens the argument that while combining mitigation and adaptation is not a magic bullet for climate policy, synergies, particularly at the project level, can contribute to the sustainable development goals of climate change and are worth exploring.",254,principal strategy managing risk mitigation recently mitigation considered separately science policy mitigation treated issue developed country hold greatest responsibility seen priority south mitigative capacity low vulnerability high conceptual divide hindered progress achievement fundamental sustainable development challenge recent attention exploring synergy mitigation suggests integrated approach could go way bridging gap development priority south need achieve global mitigation issue explored analysis policy practice bangladesh example waste compost project mitigation development nexus demonstrated project contribute mitigation reducing methane emission soil improvement drought prone area sustainable development poverty exacerbated reduces flow ecosystem service linking mitigation make mitigation action relevant policymakers bangladesh increasing international agenda preparation post kyoto global strategy strengthens argument combining mitigation magic bullet policy synergy particularly project level contribute sustainable development goal worth exploring
5,"Australian Universities, Government Research and the Application of Climate Change Knowledge in Australian Coastal Zone Management",2010-01-01,"One of the key issues in Australia for sustainable management of the coastal zone is that the science of climate change has not been widely used by decision-makers to inform coastal governance. There exist opportunities to enhance the dialogue between knowledge-makers and decision-makers, and universities have a key role to play in researching and fostering better linkages. At the heart of these linkages lies the principle of more informed engagement between historically disparate groups. In Australia, the new 'Flagship' research programme, funded by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), emphasizes their partnering with universities in a more systematic and collaborative manner than previously achieved in such research projects. In order to address sustainability in general and coastal adaptation to climate change in particular, interdisciplinary learning needs to occur between the social and natural sciences; also, transdisciplinary understanding of that interaction needs to be fully developed. New methods of communicative engagement such as computer visualizations and animations, together with deliberative techniques, can help policy-makers and planners reach a better understanding of the significance of the science of climate change impacts on the coast. Deeper engagement across historically disparate groups can lead to the development of epistemological and methodological synergies between social and natural scientists, adaptive learning, reflexive governance, and greater analytical and deliberative understanding among scientists, policymakers and the wider public. This understanding can lead in turn to enhance coastal governance for climate adaptation on the coast.",238,key issue australia sustainable management coastal zone science widely used decision maker inform coastal governance exist opportunity enhance dialogue knowledge maker decision maker university key role play researching fostering better linkage heart linkage lie principle informed historically disparate group australia flagship research programme funded commonwealth scientific industrial research organization csiro emphasizes partnering university systematic collaborative manner achieved research project order address sustainability general coastal particular interdisciplinary learning need occur social natural science transdisciplinary understanding interaction need fully developed method communicative computer visualization animation together deliberative technique help policy maker planner reach better understanding significance science impact coast deeper across historically disparate group lead development epistemological methodological synergy social natural scientist adaptive learning reflexive governance greater analytical deliberative understanding among scientist policymakers wider understanding lead turn enhance coastal governance coast

7,The New Climate Change Discourse: A Challenge for Environmental Sociology,2010-01-01,"The chapter gives an analysis of the shifting social discourse on climate change in Germany and the U.S. Climate Change Discourses (CCD) are defined as thematically focused coupled sequences of arguments that different social actors use in order to influence one another or their social contexts in order to improve the chances of their resource endowments, interests, and worldviews to prevail in collective decision making processes. The major change in the recent CCD is seen as a shift from a framework of understanding the Earth System to a framework of decision making under uncertainties. The traditional (and in part ideological) opposition of mitigation and adaptation policies will have give way to an optimal mix of both. The chapter gives empirical evidence for that analysis from mass media coverage, public opinion, policy making, and the business sector. This shift occurs currently more markedly in Germany than in the U.S., will probably catch up across the Atlantic soon. The final section sketches the outlines of a low-carbon society and discusses some major challenges to environmental sociology such as more systemic views, active engagement in IPCC's working group III, risk analysis of climate solutions, critical assessments of socio-technical experiments.",196,chapter give analysis shifting social discourse germany u discourse ccd defined thematically focused coupled sequence argument different social actor use order influence another social context order improve chance resource endowment interest worldviews prevail collective decision making process major recent ccd seen shift framework understanding earth system framework decision making uncertainty traditional part ideological opposition mitigation policy give way optimal mix chapter give empirical evidence analysis mass medium coverage opinion policy making business sector shift occurs currently markedly germany u probably catch across atlantic soon final section sketch outline low carbon society discus major challenge environmental sociology systemic view active ipcc working group iii risk analysis solution critical assessment socio technical experiment

9,Can sustainable tourism survive climate change?,2010-01-01,"This opinion piece contends that tourism's expanding engagement with climate change, as it is currently unfolding, is not necessarily conducive to the interests of tourism sustainability. Inherent unpredictability, long-term timeframes, lack of directly tangible consequences or clearly identifiable villains, issues with credibility and vested interests and cost implications in an era of chronic economic uncertainty all combine to increase the likelihood of unsuccessful climate change policies and strategies. Additional complications arise within the tourism sector from the rudimentary state of knowledge about the relationships between the tourism and climate change, an apathetic and fickle travelling public and a reciprocally uncommitted tourism industry. I argue that adaptation is a rational business response to climate change that is not directly related to environmental and sociocultural sustainability, and that mitigation measures should be supported to the extent that they yield practical and tangible short- and medium-term benefits and address local sustainability issues such as air quality and biodiversity protection.",156,opinion piece contends tourism expanding currently unfolding necessarily conducive interest tourism sustainability inherent unpredictability long term timeframes lack directly tangible consequence clearly identifiable villain issue credibility vested interest cost implication era chronic economic uncertainty combine increase likelihood unsuccessful policy strategy additional complication arise within tourism sector rudimentary state knowledge relationship tourism apathetic fickle travelling reciprocally uncommitted tourism industry argue rational business response directly related environmental sociocultural sustainability mitigation measure supported extent yield practical tangible short medium term benefit address local sustainability issue air quality biodiversity protection
10,"Creating Resilient Cities Through Empowered, Deliberative Participation",2011-01-01,"Social and physical climate change scientists agree that to effectively address climate change, we will need new 'technologies' of cooperation. Placing collaborative governance at centre stage, this paper explores how best to develop resilient cities based on best practice and innovative design. After researching best practice stakeholder collaboration, this paper analyses the common themes that characterize climate adaptation strategies, and documents the success factors typifying best practice. Based on this research and experience, it outlines the IFOK model for new governance and supporting institutional strategies. In addition, the paper argues that a more radical redesign of engagement and governance will be critical in order to achieve community resilience and joint action. It outlines how this can be achieved through collaborative governance, involving the deliberated wisdom of ordinary citizens, i.e. by instituting deliberative democracy. Examples of deliberative democratic practice across the globe are highlighted, including an innovative initiative to develop a deliberative community and collaborative governance in regional Western Australia.",159,social physical scientist agree effectively address need technology cooperation placing collaborative governance centre stage explores best develop resilient city based best practice innovative design researching best practice stakeholder collaboration analysis common theme characterize strategy document success factor typifying best practice based research experience outline ifok model governance supporting institutional strategy addition argues radical redesign governance critical order achieve community resilience joint action outline achieved collaborative governance involving deliberated wisdom ordinary citizen e instituting deliberative democracy example deliberative democratic practice across globe highlighted including innovative initiative develop deliberative community collaborative governance regional western australia
11,Talk of the city: engaging urbanites on climate change,2006-01-01,"Climate change requires societal engagement on both mitigation and adaptation. With a growing majority of people living in cities, urban dwellers and municipal decision-makers will need to reduce their emissions and other impacts on the regional and global climate while dealing with the unavoidable near-term and potential longer-term impacts of climate change. To facilitate effective societal response to climate change, a busy, distracted, and so far only marginally interested public needs to be engaged on the topic. This poses significant challenges to communication and sustained outreach efforts. This letter draws on critical insights from a three-year multi-disciplinary project that involved academics and practitioners from various disciplines and sectors of (mostly US) society and explored how to communicate climate change in ways that facilitate societal response. The letter raises questions about key audiences, appropriate messengers, framings and messages, reception of climate change information, and the choice of communication mediums and formats to achieve different communication and engagement goals.",157,requires societal mitigation growing majority people living city urban dweller municipal decision maker need reduce emission impact regional global dealing unavoidable near term potential longer term impact facilitate effective societal response busy distracted far marginally interested need engaged topic pose significant challenge communication sustained outreach effort letter draw critical insight three year multi disciplinary project involved academic practitioner various discipline sector mostly u society explored communicate way facilitate societal response letter raise question key audience appropriate messenger framing message reception information choice communication medium format achieve different communication goal
12,Archival explorations of climate variability and social vulnerability in colonial Mexico,2007-01-01,"In this paper, unpublished archival documentary sources are used to explore the vulnerability to-and implications of-climatic variability and extreme weather events in colonial Mexico. Attention focuses on three regions covering a variety of environmental, social, economic, and political contexts and histories and located at key points along a north-south rainfall gradient: Chihuahua in the arid north, Oaxaca in the wetter south and Guanajuato located in the central Mexican highlands. A number of themes are considered. First, the significance of successive, prolonged, or combined climate events as triggers of agrarian crisis. Second, a case study demonstrating the national and regional impacts of a particularly devastating climate induced famine, culminating with the so-called 'Year of Hunger' between 1785 and 1786, is presented. The way in which social networks and community engagement were rallied as a means of fortifying social resilience to this and other crises will be highlighted. Third, the impacts of selected historical flood events are explored in order to highlight how the degree of impact of a flood was a function of public expectation, preparedness and also the particular socio-economic and environmental context in which the event took place. An overview of the spatial and temporal variations in vulnerability and resilience to climatic variability and extreme weather events in colonial Mexico is then provided, considering those recorded events that could potentially relate to broader scale, possibly global, climate changes.",229,unpublished archival documentary source used explore vulnerability implication climatic variability extreme weather event colonial mexico attention focus three region covering variety environmental social economic political context history located key point along north south rainfall gradient chihuahua arid north oaxaca wetter south guanajuato located central mexican highland number theme considered first significance successive prolonged combined event trigger agrarian crisis second demonstrating national regional impact particularly devastating induced famine culminating called year hunger presented way social network community rallied mean fortifying social resilience crisis highlighted third impact selected historical flood event explored order highlight degree impact flood function expectation preparedness particular socio economic environmental context event took place overview spatial temporal variation vulnerability resilience climatic variability extreme weather event colonial mexico provided considering recorded event could potentially relate broader scale possibly global change
13,Community level adaptation to climate change: The potential role of participatory community risk assessment,2008-01-01,"This paper explores the value of using community risk assessments (CRAs) for climate change adaptation. CRA refers to participatory methods to assess hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities in support of community-based disaster risk reduction, used by many NGOs, community-based organizations, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent. We review the evolution of climate change adaptation and community-based disaster risk reduction, and highlight the challenges of integrating global climate change into a bottom-up and place-based approach. Our analysis of CRAs carried out by various national Red Cross societies shows that CRAs can help address those challenges by fostering community engagement in climate risk reduction, particularly given that many strategies to deal with current climate risks also help to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Climate change can also be explicitly incorporated in CRAs by making better use of CRA tools to assess trends, and by addressing the notion of changing risks. However, a key challenge is to keep CRAs simple enough for wide application. This demands special attention in the modification of CRA tools; in the background materials and trainings for CRA facilitators; and in the guidance for interpretation of CRA outcomes. A second challenge is the application of a limited set of CRA results to guide risk reduction in other communities and to inform national and international adaptation policy. This requires specific attention for sampling and care in scaling up qualitative findings. Finally, stronger linkages are needed between organizations facilitating CRAs and suppliers of climate information, particularly addressing the translation of climate information to the community level.

14,"Public engagement in climate change - Disjunctions, tensions and blind spots in the UK",2009-01-01,"There is much talk about engaging the public in climate change mitigation and adaptation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Governments rush to demand greater engagement of the public in tackling climate change and delivering sustainable futures. The importance that public engagement has gained as part of the UK climate agenda begs the questions of what is actually behind this call and what are the implications. This paper analyses the rationale for public engagement as enshrined in major policy documents. This rationale is clearly instrumental in that citizens are expected to engage by adopting the 'right attitude', by performing prescribed behaviours, and by consenting to proposed measures. Using recent cases of climate change mitigation and adaptation practice the paper discusses the implications of such an approach to public engagement. The paper concludes that until the manifold disjunctions between climate related policy agendas and their rationales for engagement are explicitly addressed citizen engagement will be serving incumbent interests rather than contributing to socially sustainable and democratic decision-making",166,much talk engaging mitigation united kingdom elsewhere government rush demand greater tackling delivering sustainable future importance gained part uk agenda begs question actually behind call implication analysis rationale enshrined major policy document rationale clearly instrumental citizen expected engage adopting attitude performing prescribed behaviour consenting proposed measure recent case mitigation practice discus implication approach concludes manifold disjunction related policy agenda rationale explicitly addressed serving incumbent interest rather contributing socially sustainable democratic decision making
15,Igniting change in local government: lessons learned from a bushfire vulnerability assessment,2009-01-01,"Local governments and communities have a critical role to play in adapting to climate variability and change. Spatial vulnerability assessment is one tool that can facilitate engagement between researchers and local stakeholders through the visualisation of climate vulnerability and the integration of its biophysical and socio-economic determinants. This has been demonstrated through a case study from Sydney, Australia where a bushfire vulnerability assessment was undertaken as the first-step in a project to investigate local government perceptions of climate vulnerability and adaptive capacity. A series of relevant biophysical and socio-economic indicators was identified that represented the region's exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity with respect to bushfires. These indicators were then combined to develop maps of net landscape vulnerability to bushfire. When presented in a workshop setting, vulnerability maps were successful in capturing the attention of stakeholders while simultaneously conveying information regarding the diversity of drivers that can contribute to current and future vulnerability. However, stakeholders were reluctant to embrace representations of vulnerability that differed from their own understanding of hazard, necessitating the demonstration of agreement between the vulnerability assessment and more conventional hazard assessment tools. This validation opened the door for public dissemination of vulnerability maps, the uptake and use of the assessment in local government risk assessment and adaptation planning, and more focused case-studies on barriers to adaptation.",218,local government community critical role play adapting variability spatial vulnerability assessment tool facilitate researcher local stakeholder visualisation vulnerability integration biophysical socio economic determinant demonstrated sydney australia bushfire vulnerability assessment undertaken first step project investigate local government perception vulnerability adaptive capacity series relevant biophysical socio economic indicator identified represented region exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity respect bushfires indicator combined develop map net landscape vulnerability bushfire presented workshop setting vulnerability map successful capturing attention stakeholder simultaneously conveying information regarding diversity driver contribute current future vulnerability however stakeholder reluctant embrace representation vulnerability differed understanding hazard necessitating demonstration agreement vulnerability assessment conventional hazard assessment tool validation opened door dissemination vulnerability map uptake use assessment local government risk assessment planning focused study barrier
16,"Communities, Mitigation and Adaptation",2010-01-01,"With scientific evidence showing an unprecedented rate of climate change a rate much faster than anticipated a few years ago more active climate protection engagement is needed around the globe. In this context individuals and the community level play a vital role, and there are also considerable expectations by citizens that national governments will take the lead. Yet engagement is slow, and this raises questions regarding the motivation for action and how to get widespread engagement, particularly at the local level. Some issues that have motivated action include experiencing the local impact of climate change and a realisation that it has a security impact (from many different perspectives from climate migration to socio-economic impacts). Studies that address the cost of action and inaction have placed climate change on the political map, and community leaders that have engaged from various angles such as improving air quality have gained multiple benefits for the community and the environment, as an indirect approach to local climate action. This chapter explores why the local level urgently needs to engage, and what its representatives - political leaders, staff and citizens - need to know about what they are dealing with, and why they should deal with it.",201,scientific evidence showing unprecedented rate rate much faster anticipated year ago active protection needed around globe context individual community level play vital role considerable expectation citizen national government take lead yet slow raise question regarding motivation action get widespread particularly local level issue motivated action include experiencing local impact realisation security impact many different perspective migration socio economic impact study address cost action inaction placed political map community leader engaged various angle improving air quality gained multiple benefit community environment indirect approach local action chapter explores local level urgently need engage representative political leader staff citizen need know dealing deal
17,Preparing for a changing climate: The Chicago climate action plan's adaptation strategy,2010-01-01,"The Chicago Climate Action Plan (CCAP), Chicago's roadrnap for reducing climate change impacts and adapting to the changes already occurring, relied on rigorous analysis to formulate policy decisions through stakeholder coordination and public engagement. Three key pieces of analysis contributed to Chicago's adaptation strategy: an evaluation of Chicago's higher and lower greenhouse gas emissions scenarios; an assessment of Chicago's economic risk under both emissions scenarios; and a prioritization of potential impacts using a scoring system that included likelihood of occurrence and local consequences of occurrence. Potential adaptation tactics were categorized according to their expected benefits and costs and led to the creation of working groups to develop action plans that will include primary actors, timelines, budgets, and performance measures that the City will monitor. While not essential for all cities, the impacts analysis was of high value to the adaptation strategy. However, a strategy for stakeholder engagement is crucial in ensuring that the implications of climate impacts are properly understood. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

18,Public perception of drought and climate change in southeast England,2010-01-01,"Droughts occur as a natural feature of many climates. Several southern areas of the UK experienced water stress during 20042006 because of low water availability and high water demand. Climate change scenarios suggest that drought frequency could increase here in the future. This will increase the competition for water across all sectors. Understanding people's perceptions of drought and climate change is likely to be an important factor for sustainable water management by pointing to barriers to behavioural change. A mixed methodology study using questionnaires and focus groups was conducted in the Anglian and southern regions of the UK to explore public perceptions of drought and climate change. Respondents attributed the 2004-2006 regional drought to lower than average rainfall. Water-intensive lifestyles, a growth in population, increasing housing developments, leaking pipes and the privatization of water companies were also implicated. The majority of respondents claimed to change their behaviour to conserve water during 2006. Regarding the future, and under a number of different scenarios, people were more inclined to accept restrictions than agree to pay more to ensure the supply of water. They were concerned about climate change and recognized that more frequent water shortages may be one of the impacts, but this concern did not necessarily translate into action. Barriers to engagement with climate change and water-efficient behaviour included a lack of accessible information, a lack of knowledge regarding the integration of environmental spheres, a lack of resources, and a perceived lack of institutional engagement. The barriers identified appear to pose a major challenge to successful adaptation to climate change.",259,drought occur natural feature many climate several southern area uk experienced water stress low water availability high water demand scenario suggest drought frequency could increase future increase competition water across sector understanding people perception drought likely important factor sustainable water management pointing barrier behavioural mixed methodology questionnaire focus group conducted anglian southern region uk explore perception drought respondent attributed regional drought lower average rainfall water intensive lifestyle growth population increasing housing development leaking pipe privatization water company implicated majority respondent claimed behaviour conserve water regarding future number different scenario people inclined accept restriction agree pay ensure supply water concerned recognized frequent water shortage may impact concern necessarily translate action barrier water efficient behaviour included lack accessible information lack knowledge regarding integration environmental sphere lack resource perceived lack institutional barrier identified appear pose major challenge successful
19,Framing adaptation to climate-related extreme events,2010-01-01,"Whilst mitigation has dominated policy and research agendas in recent years there is an increasing recognition that communities also need to be preparing for change that is unavoidable, partially a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases already emitted to the atmosphere. The perceived need for adaptation has also received additional impetus through the high public profile now given to the impacts of current day weather variability, particularly the significant economic and social costs associated with recent extreme events. However, being a relatively new focus for both research and policy communities; practical evidence of the extent, feasibility, efficiency, and cost effectiveness of potential adaptation options remains largely lacking. In response, this paper seeks to make a contribution to this embryonic but evolving knowledge base by considering the theoretical underpinnings of adaptation and ultimately how this translates into practice 'in the real world'. The analytical commentary, based on a bottom-up approach involving iterative engagement with key stakeholders and experts, reflects on the identification of measures that are either innovative or examples of good practice in reducing or transferring climate risks, as well as considering those 'enabling' institutional structures and processes that act to support implementation on the ground.

20,"Preparing Communities for the Impacts of Climate Change in Oregon, USA",2011-01-01,"No matter how fast society reduces greenhouse gases, rising temperatures will produce significant ecological, social, health, and economic consequences. Few public or private organizations in the US, however, have the capacity to effectively prepare for or adapt to these inevitable changes. Unless the public and private sectors begin now to prepare for these impacts, great harm and high costs will result. The Climate Leadership Initiative at the University of Oregon, with partners, instituted a multi-year programme to develop a model that can be replicated nationwide for (a) analysing potential climate impacts at the basin scale; (b) engaging government agencies and stakeholders involved with natural (e.g. landscapes, streams, and biodiversity), human (e.g. emergency response, health care, education), built (e.g. transport, irrigation, communications infrastructure and buildings), and economic (e.g. forestry, agriculture, manufacturing, tourism) systems in assessing what those likely impacts mean for their sectors; (c) helping the agencies and stakeholders develop strategies and policies to prepare their systems to withstand and adapt to climate change through methods that enhance, and not undermine, climate preparation efforts in the other sectors. We began with pilot programmes in the Rogue and Upper Willamette river basins of Oregon. We are now working in the Klamath Basin of Oregon and California and will soon move to the national level with model programmes in three to four locations across the country.

21,Overview: Adaptive Management for the Health Risks of Climate Change,2011-01-01,"Climate change is expected to increase health risks in all countries. Although public health agencies and organizations have impressive records of controlling the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes, current and planned programs and activities may need to be modified to address the additional risks of climate change. Programs and activities need to take an iterative risk management approach if they are to maintain current levels of health burdens as diseases change their geographic range and incidence in response to changing temperature and precipitation patterns and as the risks of adverse health outcomes from extreme weather events increase. Public health can learn from the experiences in ecosystem management with adaptive management, a structured and iterative process of decision-making in the face of imperfect information, with an aim of reducing uncertainty through monitoring and evaluation. Although many of the steps in adaptive management are familiar to public health, key differences include: a stronger emphasis on stakeholder engagement; taking a systems-based approach; developing interventions based on models of future impacts; and a strong and explicit focus on iterative management that can facilitate the capacity for further adaptation. Incorporating these elements into public health programs and activities will increase their effectiveness to address the health risks of climate change.",205,expected increase health risk country although health agency organization impressive record controlling burden sensitive health outcome current planned program activity may need modified address additional risk program activity need take iterative risk management approach maintain current level health burden disease geographic range incidence response changing temperature precipitation pattern risk adverse health outcome extreme weather event increase health learn experience ecosystem management adaptive management structured iterative process decision making face imperfect information aim reducing uncertainty monitoring evaluation although many step adaptive management familiar health key difference include stronger emphasis stakeholder taking system based approach developing intervention based model future impact strong explicit focus iterative management facilitate capacity incorporating element health program activity increase effectiveness address health risk
22,One model fits all? On the moderating role of emotional engagement and confusion in the elicitation of preferences for climate change adaptation policies,2011-01-01,"Environmental economic and psychological studies often implicitly assume homogeneity of respondents' decision strategies in questionnaire-based surveys. However, social psychology and behavioural research suggest that there is a wide variety of approaches that individuals use to make such choices. We explore this heterogeneity against the backdrop of so-called dual process models', analysing participants' responses in a survey of public beliefs about and preferences for climate change adaptation policies. We find that the postulate of two different types of decision-making, the systematic-analytical and the heuristic-holistic, does indeed help us to understand patterns in respondent behaviour that are, in turn, underpinned by respondents' motivation and ability to process information. Participants who were motivated and able to process the information provided were more likely to express preferences in line with their beliefs about adaptation policies, whereas those less motivated and more confused were more likely to use generalised rules-of-thumb that were not specific to the policy issue at hand. Depending on the theoretical framework of a study, such heterogeneity in response consistency and use of generic rules-of-thumb might have implications for the usefulness of survey outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings, and draw conclusions for survey-based environmental research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

23,Adaptation in agriculture: lessons for resilience from eastern regions of New Zealand,2011-01-01,"Assessments of adaptation in agriculture have evolved considerably from early, top-down, impact assessments. These early assessments, internationally and in New Zealand, provided a limited view of 'smart farmer' adaptation. While impact assessment provides some useful insights, experience with vulnerability and adaptation assessment provides a more appropriate foundation for understanding and characterising practical smart farmer adaptation. Findings are presented from 8 years of engagement with farmers in eastern regions of New Zealand. A comprehensive farm resilience picture has emerged from this work. This picture reflects a strong belief from real-world smart farmers that there is sufficient knowledge and experience to adapt to climate change. Proactive farmers are already reading multiple signals, including changes in climate, and are responding. The farm resilience picture provides a foundation for exploring alternative adaptation options and pathways for agriculture. These are presented and discussed in response to two proposed climate change scenarios, a high carbon world scenario and a rapidly decarbonising world scenario. Knowledge intensive, low input systems are consistent with the resilience picture drawn from farmers. Such systems are also consistent with a rapidly decarbonising world scenario and, it is argued, are likely to become increasingly attractive under a high carbon world scenario. A smart farming approach, focused on resilience, provides the basis for development of a response capacity, with potentially significant co-benefits in terms of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Wider issues and needs to support the further development of farm resilience, and more widely landscape or regional resilience, are identified and discussed. It is apparent from this work that ongoing engagement with smart farmers, focused on resilience, can contribute significantly to development of a coordinated 'bottom up' and 'top down' response capacity. Addressing the psychology of change is a fundamental need to ensure wider engagement.",293,assessment agriculture evolved considerably early top impact assessment early assessment internationally zealand provided view smart farmer impact assessment provides useful insight experience vulnerability assessment provides appropriate foundation understanding characterising practical smart farmer finding presented year farmer eastern region zealand comprehensive farm resilience picture emerged work picture reflects strong belief real world smart farmer sufficient knowledge experience adapt proactive farmer already reading multiple signal including change responding farm resilience picture provides foundation exploring alternative option pathway agriculture presented discussed response proposed scenario high carbon world scenario rapidly decarbonising world scenario knowledge intensive low input system consistent resilience picture drawn farmer system consistent rapidly decarbonising world scenario argued likely become increasingly attractive high carbon world scenario smart farming approach focused resilience provides basis development response capacity potentially significant co benefit term mitigation wider issue need support development farm resilience widely landscape regional resilience identified discussed apparent work ongoing smart farmer focused resilience contribute significantly development coordinated bottom top response capacity addressing psychology fundamental need ensure wider
24,"Putting vulnerability to climate change on the map: a review of approaches, benefits, and risks",2011-01-01,"There is growing demand among stakeholders across public and private institutions for spatially-explicit information regarding vulnerability to climate change at the local scale. However, the challenges associated with mapping the geography of climate change vulnerability are non-trivial, both conceptually and technically, suggesting the need for more critical evaluation of this practice. Here, we review climate change vulnerability mapping in the context of four key questions that are fundamental to assessment design. First, what are the goals of the assessment? A review of published assessments yields a range of objective statements that emphasize problem orientation or decision-making about adaptation actions. Second, how is the assessment of vulnerability framed? Assessments vary with respect to what values are assessed (vulnerability of what) and the underlying determinants of vulnerability that are considered (vulnerability to what). The selected frame ultimately influences perceptions of the primary driving forces of vulnerability as well as preferences regarding management alternatives. Third, what are the technical methods by which an assessment is conducted? The integration of vulnerability determinants into a common map remains an emergent and subjective practice associated with a number of methodological challenges. Fourth, who participates in the assessment and how will it be used to facilitate change? Assessments are often conducted under the auspices of benefiting stakeholders, yet many lack direct engagement with stakeholders. Each of these questions is reviewed in turn by drawing on an illustrative set of 45 vulnerability mapping studies appearing in the literature. A number of pathways for placing vulnerability mapping on a more robust footing are also identified.",256,growing demand among stakeholder across private institution spatially explicit information regarding vulnerability local scale however challenge associated mapping geography vulnerability non trivial conceptually technically suggesting need critical evaluation practice review vulnerability mapping context four key question fundamental assessment design first goal assessment review published assessment yield range objective statement emphasize problem orientation decision making action second assessment vulnerability framed assessment vary respect value assessed vulnerability underlying determinant vulnerability considered vulnerability selected frame ultimately influence perception primary driving force vulnerability well preference regarding management alternative third technical method assessment conducted integration vulnerability determinant common map remains emergent subjective practice associated number methodological challenge fourth participates assessment used facilitate assessment often conducted auspex benefiting stakeholder yet many lack direct stakeholder question reviewed turn drawing illustrative set vulnerability mapping study appearing literature number pathway placing vulnerability mapping robust footing identified
25,Preventing cold-related morbidity and mortality in a changing climate,2011-01-01,"Winter weather patterns are anticipated to become more variable with increasing average global temperatures. Research shows that excess morbidity and mortality occurs during cold weather periods. We critically reviewed evidence relating temperature variability, health outcomes, and adaptation strategies to cold weather. Health outcomes included cardiovascular-, respiratory-, cerebrovascular-, and all-cause morbidity and mortality. Individual and contextual risk factors were assessed to highlight associations between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics that contribute to a person's vulnerability to variability in cold weather events. Epidemiologic studies indicate that the populations most vulnerable to variations in cold winter weather are the elderly, rural and, generally, populations living in moderate winter climates. Fortunately, cold-related morbidity and mortality are preventable and strategies exist for protecting populations from these adverse health outcomes. We present a range of adaptation strategies that can be implemented at the individual, building, and neighborhood level to protect vulnerable populations from cold-related morbidity and mortality. The existing research justifies the need for increased outreach to individuals and communities for education on protective adaptations in cold weather. We propose that future climate change adaptation research couple building energy and thermal comfort models with epidemiological data to evaluate and quantify the impacts of adaptation strategies.

Specifically, it explores three interlocking drivers of the social turn in UK FCRM: (i) the need to adapt to climate change and address the lessons from associated high profile flood events; (ii) pressures to integrate FCRM with the sustainable development agenda; and (iii) a broader trend towards a civic model in UK environmental policy-making and delivery. The paper also explores the practical impact and manifestation of these drivers in current FCRM planning and delivery frameworks, and suggests several critical pathways for a deeper embedding of the approach.",133,explores evolution sociotechnical variety flood coastal risk management fcrm uk emphasis community personal community level responsibility flood risk planning awareness resilience alongside traditional centrally managed structural technical measure specifically explores three interlocking driver social turn uk fcrm need adapt address lesson associated high profile flood event ii pressure integrate fcrm sustainable development agenda iii broader trend towards civic model uk environmental policy making delivery explores practical impact manifestation driver current fcrm planning delivery framework suggests several critical pathway deeper embedding approach
27,Managed retreat of coastal communities: understanding responses to projected sea level rise,2012-01-01,"Managed retreat - the relocation of homes and infrastructure under threat from coastal flooding - is one of the few policy options available for coastal communities facing long-term risks from accelerated sea level rise. At present, little is known about how the Australian public perceives policy options to mitigate sea level rise risks. This paper explores a range of different decision-making criteria used to assess a managed retreat scheme. A metatheoretical social functionalist framework is used to make sense of personal concerns elicited from an online survey asking respondents to consider a managed retreat scheme. The framework proposes that people can act intuitively as scientists, economists, politicians, prosecutors and theologians, when considering a complex topic such as managed retreat policy. The research found that the survey respondents are more likely to consider the topic of managed retreat from multiple functional perspectives than from a single functional perspective. The type of social functionalist frameworks that people used to assess the Conditional Occupancy Rights scheme was found to be influenced by their perceptions of sea level rise risk. The findings have implications for public debates about the long-term risks of sea level rise and for engaging with the community about managed retreat policy options.",202,managed retreat relocation home infrastructure threat coastal flooding policy option available coastal community facing long term risk accelerated sea level rise present little known australian perceives policy option mitigate sea level rise risk explores range different decision making criterion used ass managed retreat scheme metatheoretical social functionalist framework used make sense personal concern elicited online survey asking respondent consider managed retreat scheme framework proposes people act intuitively scientist economist politician prosecutor theologian considering complex topic managed retreat policy research found survey respondent likely consider topic managed retreat multiple functional perspective single functional perspective type social functionalist framework people used ass conditional occupancy right scheme found influenced perception sea level rise risk finding implication debate long term risk sea level rise engaging community managed retreat policy option
28,"Public understanding of, and attitudes to, climate change: UK and international perspectives and policy",2012-01-01,"Although levels of concern and awareness about climate change have been rising in many nations over the past 20 years, climate change remains of low importance relative to other global or personal issues. Powerful contextual barriers act to prevent public engagement with it, such as psychological distancing and externalized responsibility. Despite extensive media coverage of the issue since 2006 there was a gradual decrease in public concern between 2006 and 2010. Possible explanations are issue fatigue, the impact of the global financial crisis, distrust, and the deepening politicization of the issue. Risk and uncertainty will become part of the debate about climate change policy in the future. Although engaging both the public and decision makers needs to draw upon the best guidance already developed in communicating risk, it is also likely that a radical reframing of the terms of public debate and new approaches to 'risk communication' will be needed. The most significant risk to achieving ambitious climate mitigation and adaptation goals appears to be the 'governance trap' engendered by current national and international systems of governance, such that the public and governments each seek to attribute responsibility for instigating change to the other.",194,although level concern awareness rising many nation past year remains low importance relative global personal issue powerful contextual barrier act prevent psychological distancing externalized responsibility despite extensive medium coverage issue since gradual decrease concern possible explanation issue fatigue impact global financial crisis distrust deepening politicization issue risk uncertainty become part debate policy future although engaging decision maker need draw upon best guidance already developed communicating risk likely radical reframing term debate approach risk communication needed significant risk achieving ambitious mitigation goal appears governance trap engendered current national international system governance government seek attribute responsibility instigating
29,"Conceptualising climate change in rural Australia: community perceptions, attitudes and (in)actions",2012-01-01,"Public engagement and support is essential for ensuring adaptation to climate change. The first step in achieving engagement is documenting how the general public currently perceive and understand climate change issues, specifically the importance they place on this global problem and identifying any unique challenges for individual communities. For rural communities, which rely heavily on local agriculture industries, climate change brings both potential impacts and opportunities. Yet, to date, our knowledge about how rural residents conceptualise climate change is limited. Thus, this research explores how the broader rural community-not only farmers-conceptualises climate change and responsive activities, focussing on documenting the understandings and risk perceptions of local residents from two small Australian rural communities. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted in communities in the Eden/Gippsland region on the border of New South Wales and Victoria and the north-east of Tasmania. There are conflicting views on how climate change is conceptualised, the degree of concern and need for action, the role of local industry, who will 'win' and 'lose', and the willingness of rural communities to adapt. In particular, residents who believed in anthropogenic or human-induced factors described the changing climate as evidence of 'climate change', whereas those who were more sceptical termed it 'weather variability', suggesting that there is a divide in rural Australia that, unless urgently addressed, will hinder local and national policy responses to this global issue. Engaging these communities in the twenty-first-century climate change debate will require a significant change in terminology and communication strategies.",246,support essential ensuring first step achieving documenting general currently perceive understand issue specifically importance place global problem identifying unique challenge individual community rural community rely heavily local agriculture industry brings potential impact opportunity yet date knowledge rural resident conceptualise thus research explores broader rural community farmer conceptualises responsive activity focussing documenting understanding risk perception local resident small australian rural community twenty three semi structured interview conducted community eden gippsland region border south wale victoria north east tasmania conflicting view conceptualised degree concern need action role local industry win lose willingness rural community adapt particular resident believed anthropogenic human induced factor described changing evidence whereas sceptical termed weather variability suggesting divide rural australia unless urgently addressed hinder local national policy response global issue engaging community twenty first century debate require significant terminology communication strategy

Fischhoff's model of risk communication development is used to demonstrate that CCC to date has tended to stress persuasion, rather than social movement mobilization or deliberation, and with a focus on the model's early stages. Later stages are not necessarily better, but a more diverse strategy seems superior to a focus perhaps narrowed by empathic, ideological, psychological, and resource constraints. Furthermore, even within persuasion, emphasizing a wider set of values, consequences, and audiences could be fruitful. Social movement mobilization has its own set of weaknesses, but usefully complements persuasion with a focus on developing power, subverting mainstream assumptions, and engaging people in collective action. Deliberation similarly has its drawbacks, but unlike the other two approaches does not define the solutionor even, necessarily, the problemin advance, and thus offers the chance for people of contending viewpoints to jointly develop concepts and action agendas hitherto unimagined. Simultaneous pursuit of all three strategies can to some degree offset their respective flaws, at the potential cost of diffusion of energies and contradictory messages.

31,National Climate Change Policies and Sustainable Water Management: Conflicts and Synergies,2011-01-01,"Even in the absence of climate change, freshwater ecosystems and the resources they provide for people are under great pressure because of increasing demand for water and declines in water quality. The imminent onset of climate change will exacerbate these impacts, placing even greater pressure on already stressed resources and regions. A plethora of national climate change policies have been adopted that emphasize structural adjustment in the energy sector and increasing carbon sinks. To date, most public debate on water has focused on the direct impacts of climate change on hydrology. However, there is growing evidence that climate change policies themselves may have substantial additional and negative impacts on freshwater resources and ecosystems and may thus result in maladaptation. To avoid such maladaptation, integrated, coordinated policy making is required. In this paper, national climate change policies from Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union (EU), India, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom are compared to: (i) identify where negative trade-offs exist between climate change policies and freshwater resources, (ii) analyze where institutions and structures exist to optimize integration among climate, water, and biodiversity policies, and (iii) provide a much needed overview from a broad selection of countries with a view to identifying further opportunities for theoretical exploration and testing. The synergies and conflicts among climate, energy, water, and environmental policies create additional challenges for governments to develop integrated policies to deliver multiple benefits. Success factors for better policy development identified in this assessment and synthesis include engagement of senior political leaders, cyclical policy development, multi-agency and stakeholder processes, and stronger accountability and enforcement measures.",265,even absence freshwater ecosystem resource provide people great pressure increasing demand water decline water quality imminent onset exacerbate impact placing even greater pressure already stressed resource region plethora national policy adopted emphasize structural adjustment energy sector increasing carbon sink date debate water focused direct impact hydrology however growing evidence policy may substantial additional negative impact freshwater resource ecosystem may thus maladaptation avoid maladaptation integrated coordinated policy making required national policy australia brazil china european union eu india mexico south africa tanzania united kingdom compared identify negative trade offs exist policy freshwater resource ii analyze institution structure exist optimize integration among water biodiversity policy iii provide much needed overview broad selection country view identifying opportunity theoretical exploration testing synergy conflict among energy water environmental policy create additional challenge government develop integrated policy deliver multiple benefit success factor better policy development identified assessment synthesis include senior political leader cyclical policy development multi agency stakeholder process stronger accountability enforcement measure
32,Making sense of what enables and what constrains adaptation to climate change,2011-01-01,"As a first step in responding to new phenomena such as climate change people need to make sense of these new phenomena. Social representations theory suggests that people first anchor new phenomena to what they already know and then through processes of social interaction such as conversation or engagement with public media, people objectify this anchored representation in the form of an image, metaphor or symbol. This objectification makes the phenomenon familiar and part of common sense. As such the objectified phenomenon is added as a new social object to the group's world. The social representations form an important underpinning feature of how people respond to phenomena such as climate change. The process of making sense of phenomena such as climate change is thus very much a social process and we need to understand how this process occurs in order to effectively model people's responses. In a similar vein, to understand how people respond to climate change we need to make sense of how they make sense of the situations they face; what enables and what constrains their ability to adapt to climate change. These enabling and constraining factors need to be understood as objects within the social world. Making sense of new phenomena is a highly complex process. As society grapples with making sense of climate change and having to adapt to climate change it is very difficult to predict what social objects will emerge and become objectified. This is a truly difficult situation to model. To build models of the social dimensions of climate change we will need as a first step, to be able to model this highly complex sense making process through which groups within, and society as a whole come to terms with climate change and what enables them to adapt to climate change. In this paper we describe some preliminary results from our investigations of sense making in relation to climate change and climate change adaptation among different social groups. Our data compromise almost 1000 narrative fragments of people's personal experiences of what enables and what constrains adaptation to climate change. We present some preliminary findings of patterns in how society in Australia and Canada, are making sense of adapting to climate change. Respondents in our survey revealed characteristics of their narratives and their own relationship to their narrative as well as a number of characteristics of themselves. We present preliminary results of mixed methods analysis of word association and narrative fragment data on what people think of in relation to climate change and in which factors help and which hinder adaptation to climate change. An important conclusion emerging from our preliminary analyses of the data was that there was no one consensual representation either of climate change or the factors that enable or constrain adaptation to climate change.

This chapter provides an historical overview of the public, political, and scientific concern with adaptation in America. It begins by describing the shift from the early concerns with climate change and adaptation to the more recent awakening to the need for a comprehensive approach to managing the risks from climate change, as reflected in the news media. This shift is evident from the recent debates and drafting of adaptation-related bills in Congress; to the rapidly expanding activities at the state and local government levels; to the increasing engagement of nongovernmental organizations, professional associations, scientists, and consultants. This policy rush is not underlain, however, by widespread public engagement and mobilization, nor does it rest on a solid research foundation. To help the United States prepare adequately for the impacts of climate change, funding for vulnerability and adaptation research must be significantly increased.

38,Public responses to climate change: The role of deliberation in building capacity for adaptive action,2011-01-01,"Public deliberative platforms have been argued as potentially beneficial in fostering adaptive capacity to respond to climate change. However, little is known about the veracity of such claims, and indeed how deliberation and adaptive capacity can and do intersect. In response, this paper reports on findings from a project into public responses to climate change in the Australian Capital Region. It utilises quantitative analysis-in the form of Q methodology-and qualitative analysis, to compare discourses that emerged from individual scenario-based interviews with those that emerged at the end of a 4-day public deliberative process. It shows that while the scenario interviews had an impact on participants, this impact is not sustained. By contrast, the deliberative process gave rise to new discourses, one of which (labelled 'Collective Action Imperative') is argued as indicative of a potentially constructive personal and collective adaptive capacity. However, advocating deliberative processes still requires caution, as less adaptive discourses prevailed, suggesting strong governance signals and leadership are still essential for fostering a positive public response to the challenges of climate change.

41,"The role of knowledge, learning and mental models in public perceptions of climate change related risks",2012-01-01,"Climate change represents a complex set of challenges, in part because it is marked by risks that are not easily observed and identified - risks that humans have significant difficulty estimating. A large body of research has shown that the construction of human risk perception is a complex, multi-faceted process. Determining viable mitigation and adaptation strategies toward climate change risks therefore necessitates models that appropriately reflect human knowledge systems and learning processes. In learning for a sustainable future, we must look beyond traditional measures of risk variables and obtain a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of risk behaviour. In this chapter, we aim to provide such an interdisciplinary overview. Using practical examples we outline five fundamental processes that help form, shape and guide human perceptions of climate-related risks, namely: (1) cognitive; (2) subconscious; (3) affective; (4) socio-cultural and (5) individual factors. We subsequently critically review techniques for measuring risk perception, discuss (existing) public perceptions of climate change related risks and illuminate the different mechanisms by which risk perception can influence public action.

The growing scientific consensus over the anthropogenic causes of climate change appears to sit at odds with the increasing use of risk discourses in policy: for example, to aid in climate adaptation decision making. All of this points to a need for a fundamental revision of our conceptualization of what it is to do climate risk communication. This Special Collection comprises seven papers stimulated by a workshop on Climate Risk Perceptions and Communication held at Cumberland Lodge Windsor in 2010. Topics addressed include climate uncertainties, images and the media, communication and public engagement, uncertainty transfer in climate communication, the role of emotions, localization of hazard impacts, and longitudinal analyses of climate perceptions. Climate change risk perceptions and communication work is critical for future climate policy and decisions.",152,increasingly salient issue society policy maker worldwide raise fundamental interdisciplinary issue risk uncertainty analysis communication growing scientific consensus anthropogenic cause appears sit odds increasing use risk discourse policy example aid decision making point need fundamental revision conceptualization risk communication special collection comprises seven paper stimulated workshop risk perception communication held cumberland lodge windsor topic addressed include uncertainty image medium communication uncertainty transfer communication role emotion localization hazard impact longitudinal analysis perception risk perception communication work critical future policy decision
43,A public health frame arouses hopeful emotions about climate change,2012-01-01,"Communication researchers and practitioners have suggested that framing climate change in terms of public health and/or national security may make climate change more personally relevant and emotionally engaging to segments of the public who are currently disengaged or even dismissive of the issue. To evaluate these assumptions, using a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N = 1,127) conducted in December, 2010, we randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions. Subjects were asked to read uniquely framed news articles about climate change emphasizing either the risks to the environment, public health, or national security and the benefits of mitigation and adaptation-related actions. Results show that across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Findings also indicated that the national security frame may possibly boomerang among audience segments already doubtful or dismissive of the issue, eliciting unintended feelings of anger.",165,communication researcher practitioner suggested framing term health national security may make personally relevant emotionally engaging segment currently disengaged even dismissive issue evaluate assumption nationally representative online survey u resident n conducted december randomly assigned six identified audience segment three experimental condition subject asked read uniquely framed news article emphasizing either risk environment health national security benefit mitigation related action result across audience segment health focus likely elicit emotional reaction consistent support mitigation finding indicated national security frame may possibly boomerang among audience segment already doubtful dismissive issue eliciting unintended feeling anger
44,"Rising sea and threatened mangroves: a case study on stakeholders, engagement in climate change communication and non-formal education",2012-01-01,"Scientific consensus shows that the changes related to climate change are already occurring and will intensify in the future. This will likely result in significant alterations to coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, increase coastal hazards and affect lifestyles of coastal communities. There is increasing speculation that mangrove, a socio-economically important ecosystem, will become more fragile and sensitive to uncertain climate variability such as sea level rise. As a result, mangrove-dependent societies may find themselves trapped in a downward spiral of ecological degradation in terms of their livelihoods and life security. Strengthening the resilience capacity of coastal communities to help them cope with this additional threat from climate change and to ensure sustainability calls for immediate action. In this context, this paper critically examines the regional implications of expected sea level rise and threats to mangrove-dependent communities through a case study approach. The main objective is to highlight the requirement for climate change communication and education to impart information that will fulfil three expectations: (1) confer understanding; (2) assess local inference on climate change through a participatory approach; and (3) construct a framework for climate change awareness among mangrove-dependent communities through community-based non-formal climate change education. This scale of approach is attracting increasing attention from policymakers to achieve climate change adaptation and derive policies from a social perspective.",217,scientific consensus show change related already occurring intensify future likely significant alteration coastal ecosystem mangrove increase coastal hazard affect lifestyle coastal community increasing speculation mangrove socio economically important ecosystem become fragile sensitive uncertain variability sea level rise mangrove dependent society may find trapped downward spiral ecological degradation term livelihood life security strengthening resilience capacity coastal community help cope additional threat ensure sustainability call immediate action context critically examines regional implication expected sea level rise threat mangrove dependent community approach main objective highlight requirement communication education impart information fulfil three expectation confer understanding ass local inference participatory approach construct framework awareness among mangrove dependent community community based non formal education scale approach attracting increasing attention policymakers achieve derive policy social perspective
45,Reciprocity as deliberative capacity: lessons from a citizen's deliberation on carbon pricing mechanisms in Australia,2013-01-01,"Australia has seen a deep division in opinion in search of a carbon pricing mechanism. While concepts of carbon taxation and emission trading have comparable public support, climate scepticism is influencing the debates in political and public spheres in downplaying the need for carbon pricing. Public deliberation is a possible engagement option to address the conflict inherent in climate policy preferences. This research explores the way that a deliberative forum involving twenty-four Australians promoted effective communication between participants through which conflict between policy preferences became more tangible. While the forum did not eliminate disagreement in preferences in the choice of carbon pricing mechanisms, participants reached consensus on fundamental principles such as the need for trusted sources of information, trusted governance procedures, and transparent accountability by appropriate institutions. Shared political expectations encouraged dialogue and cooperation in discussions by enhancing reciprocal understanding. Two sceptical participants who originally had strong opinions different from the rest of the group managed to find common ground. Public deliberative forums that are conducive to reciprocal communication are able to provide a mechanism for joint problem-solving processes that are less adversarial and more responsive to the range of people's preferences.",192,australia seen deep division opinion search carbon pricing mechanism concept carbon taxation emission trading comparable support scepticism influencing debate political sphere downplaying need carbon pricing deliberation possible option address conflict inherent policy preference research explores way deliberative forum involving twenty four australian promoted effective communication participant conflict policy preference became tangible forum eliminate disagreement preference choice carbon pricing mechanism participant reached consensus fundamental principle need trusted source information trusted governance procedure transparent accountability appropriate institution shared political expectation encouraged dialogue cooperation discussion enhancing reciprocal understanding sceptical participant originally strong opinion different rest group managed find common ground deliberative forum conducive reciprocal communication able provide mechanism joint problem solving process le adversarial responsive range people preference
46,"Integrating Collaboration, Adaptive Management, and Scenario-Planning: Experiences at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area",2013-01-01,"There is growing recognition that public lands cannot be managed as islands; rather, land management must address the ecological, social, and temporal complexity that often spans jurisdictions and traditional planning horizons. Collaborative decision making and adaptive management (CAM) have been promoted as methods to reconcile competing societal demands and respond to complex ecosystem dynamics. We detail the experiences of land managers and stakeholders in using CAM at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), a highly valued site under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The CAM process at Las Cienegas is marked by strong stakeholder engagement, with four core elements: (1) shared watershed goals with measurable resource objectives; (2) relevant and reliable scientific information; (3) mechanisms to incorporate new information into decision making; and (4) shared learning to improve both the process and management actions. The combination of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management has led to agreement on contentious issues, more innovative solutions, and more effective land management. However, the region is now experiencing rapid changes outside managers' control, including climate change, human population growth, and reduced federal budgets, with large but unpredictable impacts on natural resources. Although the CAM experience provides a strong foundation for making the difficult and contentious management decisions that such changes are likely to require, neither collaboration nor adaptive management provides a sufficient structure for addressing the externalities that drive uncontrollable and unpredictable change. As a result, LCNCA is exploring two specific modifications to CAM that may better address emerging challenges, including: (1) creating nested resource objectives to distinguish between those objectives that may be crucial to maintaining ecological resilience from those that may hinder a flexible response to climate change, and (2) incorporating scenario planning into CAM to explore how climate change may interact with other drivers and alter options for the future, to identify robust management actions, and to prioritize ecological monitoring efforts. The experiences at LCNCA demonstrate how collaboration and adaptive management can be used to improve social and environmental outcomes and, with modifications, may help address the full range of complexity and change that threatens to overwhelm even the best efforts to sustain public lands.",357,growing recognition land cannot managed island rather land management must address ecological social temporal complexity often span jurisdiction traditional planning horizon collaborative decision making adaptive management cam promoted method reconcile competing societal demand respond complex ecosystem dynamic detail experience land manager stakeholder cam la cienegas national conservation area lcnca highly valued site jurisdiction bureau land management blm cam process la cienegas marked strong stakeholder four core element shared watershed goal measurable resource objective relevant reliable scientific information mechanism incorporate information decision making shared learning improve process management action combination stakeholder adaptive management led agreement contentious issue innovative solution effective land management however region experiencing rapid change outside manager control including human population growth reduced federal budget unpredictable impact natural resource although cam experience provides strong foundation making difficult contentious management decision change likely require neither collaboration adaptive management provides sufficient structure addressing externality drive uncontrollable unpredictable lcnca exploring specific modification cam may better address emerging challenge including creating nested resource objective distinguish objective may crucial maintaining ecological resilience may hinder flexible response incorporating scenario planning cam explore may interact driver alter option future identify robust management action prioritize ecological monitoring effort experience lcnca demonstrate collaboration adaptive management used improve social environmental outcome modification may help address full range complexity threatens overwhelm even best effort sustain land
47,Erosive coping after the 2011 floods in Kenya,2013-01-01,"Periodic river floods have devastating social and economic impacts on poor households in the low-lying coastal and western regions of Kenya. This paper focuses on how households in Bunyala District coped with the impacts of flooding, and particularly the December 2011 River Nzoia flood. The data for the study was collected through a survey of 400 households, three focus group discussions, four in-depth interviews and six key informant interviews. Of the surveyed household-heads, 393 (98.4%) reported negative impacts of the flood on farming, livestock and/or property. Coping strategies at household level included temporary relocation and migration, reduced expenditure on household needs, engagement in extra income-generating activities, selling of property and reliance on support from public and private agencies. The findings reveal that many of the coping measures that people use are erosive, as they have negative long-term effects on household livelihood sustainability.",142,periodic river flood devastating social economic impact poor household low lying coastal western region kenya focus household bunyala district coped impact flooding particularly december river nzoia flood data collected survey household three focus group discussion four depth interview six key informant interview surveyed household head reported negative impact flood farming livestock property coping strategy household level included temporary relocation migration reduced expenditure household need extra income generating activity selling property reliance support private agency finding reveal many coping measure people use erosive negative long term effect household livelihood sustainability
48,Australian residents' attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour and climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef,2013-01-01,"Climate change and associated environmental impacts are increasingly important issues. Effective communication with residents of coastal communities is critical to mitigate and adapt to changing conditions; however, this can be a challenging feat without an understanding of attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour. Drawing on three dimensions of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, this paper: (1) explores the Australian public's perceptions of climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef; (2) segments respondents into homogenous groups based on their environmental attitudes; and (3) profiles the emergent segments using managerially-relevant indicators. Study findings illustrate that respondents can be organised into five distinct segments according to their attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour that could potentially stem climate change-related impacts. These segments perceive a variety of threats to the health of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, underestimate the performance of behaviours that help to mitigate impacts and face a variety of internal and external constraints on behavioural engagement.",152,associated environmental impact increasingly important issue effective communication resident coastal community critical mitigate adapt changing condition however challenging feat without understanding attitude toward pro environmental behaviour drawing three dimension theory planned behaviour explores australian perception impact great barrier reef segment respondent homogenous group based environmental attitude profile emergent segment managerially relevant indicator finding illustrate respondent organised five distinct segment according attitude toward pro environmental behaviour could potentially stem related impact segment perceive variety threat health great barrier reef ecosystem underestimate performance behaviour help mitigate impact face variety internal external constraint behavioural

50,"Engaging the private sector in adaptation to climate change in developing countries: importance, status, and challenges",2013-01-01,"In developing countries there is a need for the private sector to be more engaged in identifying climate change risks, response measures, and adaptation, and to prioritize these more highly. The importance of the role of the private sector is evident from lessons drawn from the increasing amount of empirical experience on adaptation projects supported by climate funds: successful private sector engagement in adaptation will catalyse greater investment in reducing vulnerability; this in turn will accelerate the replication of climate-resilient technologies and services in core development sectors, especially in developing countries where investment in long-lived infrastructure is growing rapidly. Private sector companies should integrate adaptation into their strategies and investments for their own economic interest, as well as for their clients' interest and for the interests of the countries in which they operate. Unfortunately, private sector efforts on adaptation are not widely understood or seen as good business practice, and generally face several obstacles. Public policy should incentivize such investments by communicating risks, offering incentives for resilience enhancing measures, and where necessary by putting in place regulation to avoid shifting risks onto the public. Stronger public-private partnerships will also help to enhance climate resilience, and at the same time create business opportunities. Private firms will develop many of the products and services that will enable lower cost and more effective responses to climate change, which can be the basis for growing businesses. Ultimately, a paradigm shift is required for business to fully integrate the value associated with managing climate risks.",250,developing country need private sector engaged identifying risk response measure prioritize highly importance role private sector evident lesson drawn increasing amount empirical experience project supported fund successful private sector catalyse greater investment reducing vulnerability turn accelerate replication resilient technology service core development sector especially developing country investment long lived infrastructure growing rapidly private sector company integrate strategy investment economic interest well client interest interest country operate unfortunately private sector effort widely understood seen good business practice generally face several obstacle policy incentivize investment communicating risk offering incentive resilience enhancing measure necessary putting place regulation avoid shifting risk onto stronger private partnership help enhance resilience time create business opportunity private firm develop many product service enable lower cost effective response basis growing business ultimately paradigm shift required business fully integrate value associated managing risk
51,Reframing Engagement Methods for Climate Change Adaptation,2013-01-01,"Climate change poses known and unknown risks for coastal communities and also challenges for university faculty and local government staff who communicate about cli- mate sciences. Conceived as a way to move beyond traditional models of science communication, this project involved public and private decision makers in specific at-risk communities in Oregon (U.S. Pacific coast) and Maine (Atlantic coast). Both state projects sought to move behavior toward decisive action that results in coastal communities that are more resilient to climate variability at all scales. To promote engagement between project staffs and publics, a dialogic model of communication was advanced, beginning with interviews and focus groups that in turn shaped further engagement through workshops and targeted video products. This means of communication led to a deeper understanding of participants' knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, values, and barriers to action related to climate change and its effects. Coinciding with this, project participant evaluations in both Oregon and Maine indicate that the workshops and videos were successful at informing them on this complex issue; and in both states, project participation led to action outcomes.

52,Private sector engagement in climate change adaptation in least developed countries: an exploration,2013-01-01,"The private sector is increasingly being engaged in climate finance and climate-related activities. Private sector opportunities for engagement in climate change adaptation are less clear than for mitigation, particularly in developing countries. This article first conceptualizes private sector engagement in adaptation by exploring (1) different roles of the private sector in adaptation in developing countries and (2) the way governments can create an enabling environment to increase private sector engagement. Second, it analyses how 47 least developed countries (LDCs) envisage the role of the private sector in their National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). This article argues that private sector engagement in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant. Yet, the results show that it receives little attention in NAPAs. This may have three explanations: (1) an intentional approach of LDCs to avoid a distraction from the necessity to scale up public funding; (2) a lack of awareness of the potential of the private sector; and (3) the NAPA formulation guidelines focus on the public sector in the context of public financing, potentially causing path dependency. Developed countries' historic responsibility for emissions obliges them to upscale public climate finance.

53,"National-level factors affecting planned, public adaptation to health impacts of climate change",2013-01-01,"Our understanding of whether adaptive capacity on a national level is being translated into adaptation policies, programs, and projects is limited. Focusing on health adaptation in Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC, we examine whether statistically significant relationships exist between regulatory, institutional, financial, and normative aspects of national-level adaptive capacity and systematically measured adaptation. Specifically, we (i) quantify adaptation actions in Annex I nations, (ii) identify potential factors that might impact progress on adaptation and select measures for these factors, and (iii) calculate statistical relationships between factors and adaptation actions across countries. Statistically significant relationships are found between progress on adaptation and engagement in international environmental governance, national environmental governance, perception of corruption in the public sector, population size, and national wealth, as well as between responsiveness to health vulnerabilities, population size and national wealth. This analysis contributes two key early empirical findings to the growing literature concerning factors facilitating or constraining adaptation. While country size and wealth are necessary for driving higher levels of adaptation, they may be insufficient in the absence of policy commitments to environmental governance. Furthermore, governance and/or incentive frameworks for environmental governance at the national level may be an important indicator of the strength of national commitments to addressing health impacts of climate change.

If the frequency and severity continue or increase, adaptation and mitigation efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations and improve daily life under changed weather conditions. This field report examines the devastation due to Hurricane Sandy experienced in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York, a neighborhood consisting of geographically isolated low-lying commercial and residential units, with a concentration of low-income housing, and disproportionate rates of poverty and poor health outcomes largely experienced by Black and Latino residents. Multiple sources of data were reviewed, including street canvasses, governmental reports, community flyers, and meeting transcripts, as well as firsthand observations by a local nonprofit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) and community members, and social media accounts of the effects of Sandy and the response to daily needs. These data are considered within existing theory, evidence, and practice on protecting public health during extreme weather events. Firsthand observations show that a community-based organization in Red Hook, RHI, was at the center of the response to disaster relief, despite the lack of staff training in response to events such as Hurricane Sandy. Review of these data underscores that adaptation and response to climate change and likely resultant extreme weather is a dynamic process requiring an official coordinated governmental response along with on-the-ground volunteer community responders.",227,frequency intensity extreme weather event increased recent decade example hurricane sandy frequency severity continue increase mitigation effort needed protect vulnerable population improve daily life changed weather condition field report examines devastation due hurricane sandy experienced red hook brooklyn york neighborhood consisting geographically isolated low lying commercial residential unit concentration low income housing disproportionate rate poverty poor health outcome largely experienced black latino resident multiple source data reviewed including street canvass governmental report community flyer meeting transcript well firsthand observation local nonprofit red hook initiative rhi community member social medium account effect sandy response daily need data considered within existing theory evidence practice protecting health extreme weather event firsthand observation community based organization red hook rhi center response disaster relief despite lack staff training response event hurricane sandy review data underscore response likely resultant extreme weather dynamic process requiring official coordinated governmental response along ground volunteer community responder
56,Climate Change Adaptive Capacity in Santiago de Chile: Creating a Governance Regime for Sustainability Planning,2013-01-01,"For most urban areas, the challenges of adaptation are as urgent as those of mitigation. This is particularly the case where adaptive capacity is weak, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and the benefits of global mitigation in the short term will be experienced beyond 2050. A focus on adaptive capacity-building in these vulnerable settings is imperative. Much of the emphasis in climate change since the early 1990s has been on basic science and how public policy should respond to it; less attention has been paid to the governance implications and connections with wider development processes. This article explores the governance challenges of adaptation in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. It points to weaknesses in the water and energy sectors, which have highly sectoral, horizontally unintegrated institutional structures and instruments that pose significant challenges for adaptation. Such cases point to the need to engage with both the wider planning concerns of existing development strategies and the basic elements of transdisciplinarity, finance and human capital-building, in order to forge a more integrated adaptation response. Without an engagement with the governance issue and wider debates around metropolitan planning and socioeconomic development, it is unlikely the response will move beyond a limited physical infrastructure investment programme.",202,urban area challenge urgent mitigation particularly adaptive capacity weak particularly low middle income country benefit global mitigation short term experienced beyond focus adaptive capacity building vulnerable setting imperative much emphasis since early basic science policy respond le attention paid governance implication connection wider development process explores governance challenge santiago metropolitan region point weakness water energy sector highly sectoral horizontally unintegrated institutional structure instrument pose significant challenge case point need engage wider planning concern existing development strategy basic element transdisciplinarity finance human capital building order forge integrated response without governance issue wider debate around metropolitan planning socioeconomic development unlikely response move beyond physical infrastructure investment programme

Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning.",207,examines network structure policy learning c city leadership group network world largest city committed tackling issue among forty member nineteen affiliate member ask question city learn policy learning relationship associated city multi stakeholder governing body policy performance cultural similarity study learning analyzed condition facilitating learning quantitative study local government learning global network rare facilitate investigation learning conceptualize learning process comprising information seeking adoption policy focus information seeking foundation step learning process social network analysis exponential random graph model reveals city seek information information source different subgroup furthermore analysis nodal attribute suggests transmunicipal learning c network facilitated presence multi stakeholder governing body homophily culture language regional proximity higher level policy performance creating multi stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness citizen relevant stakeholder enhance policy decision making well policy learning

The perspectives of energy systems and climate change play an important role in the development and implementation of emerging energy technologies and attendant policies on greenhouse gas reduction. This research examines citizens' views on climate change and a number of energy systems, with a specific focus on the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a technology to address greenhouse gas emissions. An all-day workshop with 82 local participants was held in the city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada to explore the views of climate change, energy and CCS: Participants were provided the opportunity to ask experts questions and discuss in small groups their views of climate change policy and energy systems. Results demonstrate that participants' assessments of energy systems are influenced by social-political-institutional-economic contexts such as trust in industry and government, perception of parties benefiting from the technology, and tradeoffs between energy systems.

60,Learning with practitioners: climate change adaptation priorities in a Canadian community,2013-01-01,"Adaptation is already a necessary response to climate change for northern communities. The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes.

61,"Combining qualitative and quantitative understanding for exploring cross-sectoral climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability in Europe",2013-01-01,"Climate change will affect all sectors of society and the environment at all scales, ranging from the continental to the national and local. Decision-makers and other interested citizens need to be able to access reliable science-based information to help them respond to the risks of climate change impacts and assess opportunities for adaptation. Participatory integrated assessment (IA) tools combine knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines, take account of the value and importance of stakeholder 'lay insight' and facilitate a two-way iterative process of exploration of 'what if's' to enable decision-makers to test ideas and improve their understanding of the complex issues surrounding adaptation to climate change. This paper describes the conceptual design of a participatory IA tool, the CLIMSAVE IA Platform, based on a professionally facilitated stakeholder engagement process. The CLIMSAVE (climate change integrated methodology for cross-sectoral adaptation and vulnerability in Europe) Platform is a user-friendly, interactive web-based tool that allows stakeholders to assess climate change impacts and vulnerabilities for a range of sectors, including agriculture, forests, biodiversity, coasts, water resources and urban development. The linking of models for the different sectors enables stakeholders to see how their interactions could affect European landscape change. The relationship between choice, uncertainty and constraints is a key cross-cutting theme in the conduct of past participatory IA.

62,Participatory scenario development for environmental management: A methodological framework illustrated with experience from the UK uplands,2013-01-01,"A methodological framework is proposed for participatory scenario development on the basis of evidence from the literature, and is tested and refined through the development of scenarios for the future of UK uplands. The paper uses a review of previous work to justify a framework based around the following steps: i) define context and establish whether there is a basis for stakeholder engagement in scenario development; ii) systematically identify and represent relevant stakeholders in the process; iii) define clear objectives for scenario development with stakeholders including spatial and temporal boundaries; iv) select relevant participatory methods for scenario development, during initial scenario construction, evaluation and to support decision-making based on scenarios; and v) integrate local and scientific knowledge throughout the process. The application of this framework in case study research suggests that participatory scenario development has the potential to: i) make scenarios more relevant to stakeholder needs and priorities; ii) extend the range of scenarios developed; iii) develop more detailed and precise scenarios through the integration of local and scientific knowledge; and iv) move beyond scenario development to facilitate adaptation to future change.

63,Strategic Bundling of Development Policies with Adaptation: An Examination of Delhi's Climate Change Action Plan,2013-01-01,"A growing number of cities in the global South are taking proactive action on climate change. Their plans provide insights into the potential for strategically bundling long-term development policymaking with the climate agenda. In this article I study the case of Delhi, the first city in India to adopt a climate change action plan. Drawing on the literature on urban ecological security, I examine: (1) the adaptation challenges that Delhi faces; (2) the multiple motivations that underlie early action; (3) the key actors, strategies, and associated action domains outlined in the plan; and (4) the extent to which the plan seeks to bring about systemic change. Proactive action at the city level serves multiple strategic goals. Delhi's case is significant in illustrating how it has leveraged emergent opportunities to advance its short-term development agenda, given the tight fiscal constraints and governance challenges it faces. The plan has been strategically formulated to enhance competiveness, facilitate image-building, garner support for pet projects and access alternative sources of funding. But the short-term orientation of the plan and its limited mechanisms for citizen engagement have severely restrained its capacity to address underlying social vulnerabilities or bring about transformative change.",195,growing number city global south taking proactive action plan provide insight potential strategically bundling long term development policymaking agenda delhi first city india adopt action plan drawing literature urban ecological security examine challenge delhi face multiple motivation underlie early action key actor strategy associated action domain outlined plan extent plan seek bring systemic proactive action city level serf multiple strategic goal delhi significant illustrating leveraged emergent opportunity advance short term development agenda given tight fiscal constraint governance challenge face plan strategically formulated enhance competiveness facilitate image building garner support pet project access alternative source funding short term orientation plan mechanism severely restrained capacity address underlying social vulnerability bring transformative
64,Mainstreaming climate change adaptation: An incremental approach to disaster risk management in Australia,2013-01-01,"In this paper we argue that rationalist 'predict then act' approaches to disaster risk management (DRM) policy promote unrealistic public expectations of DRM provisions, the avoidance of decision making by political elites, an over-reliance on technical expertise and engineering solutions to reducing exposure to natural events, and a reactive approach to DRM overall. We propose an alternative incrementalist approach that focuses on managing uncertainties rather than reducing them and building resilience not simply through the reduction of hazard exposure, but also through the ongoing reduction of community vulnerability, the explicit consideration of normative priorities, and more effective community engagement in climate risk debates.

65,Planning for Climate Change: Is Greater Public Participation the Key to Success?,2013-01-01,"Within most democracies there is an assumption that greater public participation and engagement in policy processes results in more effective policy measures. These assumed benefits include better framed and more robust policies and a more informed, articulate and engaged citizenry. Similar assumptions exist also in planning for climate adaptation where more public participation and engagement are seen as vital components of any adaptation strategy and policy development process. This article explores these assumptions and considers whether there is any evidence that the success of planning for unavoidable climate change is related to the extent of public participation. Using an evaluation framework based on three aspects of participation we critically review a set of climate adaptation policy instruments developed within each of the three levels of government in Australia but with a specific focus on the region of South East Queensland.",140,within democracy assumption greater participation policy process result effective policy measure assumed benefit include better framed robust policy informed articulate engaged citizenry similar assumption exist planning participation seen vital component strategy policy development process explores assumption considers whether evidence success planning unavoidable related extent participation evaluation framework based three aspect participation critically review set policy instrument developed within three level government australia specific focus region south east queensland

The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate the effect of a new approach in promoting more functional ways to face stressful situations in the constellation of people around patients: caregivers, physicians and nurses. Thirty-four subjects were divided into three groups: 10 care-givers, 11 physicians, and 13 nurses. A ""Balint Group"" method modified according to a mind-fulness technique was used as the intervention. Three assessment tools were administered to the participants at baseline, during, and after completion of the study: the Response Evaluation Measure (REM-71), the Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P), and the Group Climate Questionnaire (GCQ). Mean values of defense mechanisms determined by the REM-71 were compared with those of the standard population. At baseline, we observed a prevalence of immature defenses in the three groups, with mean values above those in the standard population. After the psychological intervention, a tendency to normalization of the mean values was observed, indicating the development of more adaptive ways of using defense mechanisms and the effectiveness of the intervention. Group climate, assessed through the GCQ, showed an increase in the ""Engagement"" factor and a decline in the ""Conflict"" factor in all groups. This study suggests that group treatment focused on changing personal responses to stressful situations can induce more adaptive strategies enabling caregivers, hematologists, and nurses to help patients better and thereby improve their quality of life.",246,much evidence demonstrating psychosocial intervention caregiver oncological staff produce improvement patient quality life aim explorative evaluate effect approach promoting functional way face stressful situation constellation people around patient caregiver physician nurse thirty four subject divided three group care giver physician nurse balint group method modified according mind fulness technique used intervention three assessment tool administered participant baseline completion response evaluation measure rem satisfaction profile sat p group questionnaire gcq mean value defense mechanism determined rem compared standard population baseline observed prevalence immature defense three group mean value standard population psychological intervention tendency normalization mean value observed indicating development adaptive way defense mechanism effectiveness intervention group assessed gcq showed increase factor decline conflict factor group suggests group treatment focused changing personal response stressful situation induce adaptive strategy enabling caregiver hematologist nurse help patient better thereby improve quality life
69,Adapting to climate change through urban water management: a participatory case study in Indonesia,2014-01-01,"The benefits of integrated approaches to climate risk and adaptation studies are increasingly recognised. Thus, there is an increasing need for practical examples of such work in the literature. This paper describes a practical application of an integrated framework for climate change impacts on regional surface water resources and the urban water system in the Mamminasata metropolitan region, Indonesia. Two main features of the framework are: the integration of both climate and other physical and social considerations in the assessment; and the high stakeholder involvement before, during and after project implementation. Although the study is concerned with the Mamminasata region, the overall methodology is transferable to any region in Indonesia or internationally. Key outcomes from this study are: (1) creation of information for Mamminasata planners and water resources managers for when, and under what conditions, the water supply may or may not meet the demand; (2) a clear consensus and shared learning of the problems facing the region among cross-institutional stakeholders; and (3) identification of adaptation options for the urban water system and knowledge gaps and strategies for their implementation. Results of stakeholders' surveys conducted at the mid-point and at the end of the study indicate that these outputs will provide valuable guidance for future planning and management of Mamminasata regional water resources.",213,benefit integrated approach risk study increasingly recognised thus increasing need practical example work literature describes practical application integrated framework impact regional surface water resource urban water system mamminasata metropolitan region indonesia main feature framework integration physical social consideration assessment high stakeholder involvement project implementation although concerned mamminasata region overall methodology transferable region indonesia internationally key outcome creation information mamminasata planner water resource manager condition water supply may may meet demand clear consensus shared learning problem facing region among cross institutional stakeholder identification option urban water system knowledge gap strategy implementation result stakeholder survey conducted mid point end indicate output provide valuable guidance future planning management mamminasata regional water resource
70,Climate change research and policy in Portugal,2014-01-01,"This article offers a review of research and policy on climate change in Portugal and is organized into three main themes: scientific knowledge and assessment of climate change; policy analysis and evaluation; and public engagement. Modern scientific research on meteorology and climatology started in Portugal in the 1950s and a strong community of researchers in climate science, vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptation has since developed, particularly in the last decade. Nevertheless, there are still many gaps in research, especially regarding the economic costs of climate change in Portugal and costs and benefits of adaptation. Governmental policies with a strong emphasis on mitigation were introduced at the end of the 1990s. As greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise beyond its Kyoto target for 2012, the country had to resort to the Kyoto Flexibility Mechanisms in order to comply. Climate change adaptation policies were introduced in 2010 but are far from being fully implemented. Regarding public engagement with climate change, high levels of concern contrast with limited understanding and rather weak behavioral dispositions to address climate change. Citizens display a heavy reliance on the media as sources of information, which are dominated by a techno-managerial discourse mainly focused on the global level. The final part of the article identifies research gaps and outlines a research agenda. Connections between policy and research are also discussed.

71,Is the private forest sector adapting to climate change? A study of forest managers in north Wales,2014-01-01,"Two-thirds of Britain's forest area is privately owned. Thus, understanding private forest owners and managers, and their attitudes to uncertainty and change, is essential for the success of climate change adaptation policies. The aims of this study are to (1) assess how beliefs in climate change in the private sector have influenced forest management practices; (2) identify constraints related to changes in species choice and silvicultural systems; (3) analyse the implications for implementing climate change policy in forestry. Semi-structured interviews with key informants who provide advice to, or manage woodlands in, the private forest sector in north Wales. Woodland managers and some advisers are not generally convinced of a need to adapt. They feel the future is uncertain, more usually in relation to tree disease than to climate change itself. Species choice is the principle focus of adaptation activities and reveals a deep divide in opinion. Commercial advisors look to new exotics but are inhibited by absence of markets, while small-scale owners rely more on native genetic diversity. Findings that are likely to apply widely include: the influential role of forest agents in forest management decisions including species choice; lack of confidence in climate change predictions, and in markets; more immediate concerns about tree pests and diseases; demand for leadership from the public sector, and for engagement amongst the private sector.

It explores the language used to discuss adaptation, what is known about resonant frames, drawing on adaptation discourses in policy, practice, and the media. Identifying trends and widely applicable insights is made challenging not only by the variety of words used to speak of adaptation, but by the fact that adaptation' language is often not used at all. A broad literature on perceptions and experiences of climate change impacts and how these experiences affect people's valuations and emotional responses to climate change offers crucial insights to the challenges and opportunities in communicating adaptation. It reveals much about people's interest in and acceptability and knowledge of adaptation, about preferred timing and who is thought to be responsible for enacting adaptive actions. Insights from the literature on place attachment and place identity are of particular relevance to public engagement on adaptation as it goes a long way toward explaining the quality of the adaptation debate to date while offering promising opportunities for dialogue.

Where complex science and technology issues are involved in policy making, this takes time, so it is important to identify emerging issues of this type and prepare engagement plans. In our horizon scanning exercise, we used a modified Delphi technique [1]. A wide group of people with interests in the science and policy interface (drawn from policy makers, policy adviser, practitioners, the private sector and academics) elicited a long list of emergent policy issues in which science and technology would feature strongly and which would also necessitate public engagement as policies are developed. This was then refined to a short list of top priorities for policy makers. Thirty issues were identified within broad areas of business and technology; energy and environment; government, politics and education; health, healthcare, population and aging; information, communication, infrastructure and transport; and public safety and national security.",169,policy requires support turn implies need enable understand policy engaged development complex science technology issue involved policy making take time important identify emerging issue type prepare plan horizon scanning exercise used modified delphi technique wide group people interest science policy interface drawn policy maker policy adviser practitioner private sector academic elicited long list emergent policy issue science technology would feature strongly would necessitate policy developed refined short list top priority policy maker thirty issue identified within broad area business technology energy environment government politics education health healthcare population aging information communication infrastructure transport safety national security

The country has examined their vulnerabilities to climate change and many public health impacts have been projected. A variety of qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used in the assessment: literature reviews, interviews, focus groups, time series and regression analysis, damage and adaptation cost estimation, and scenario-based assessment. Policies and interventions to minimize the risks and development of long-term adaptation strategies have been explored. The generation of a robust evidence base and the development of stakeholder engagement have been used to support the development of an adaptation strategy and to promote adaptive capacity by improving the resilience of public health systems to climate change. Climate change adaptation has been established as a priority within existing national policy instruments.

75,Narrative research in climate change adaptation-Exploring a complementary paradigm for research and governance,2014-01-01,"Climate adaptation research increasingly focuses on the socio-cultural dimensions of change. In this context, narrative research is often seen as a qualitative social science method used to frame adaptation communication. However, this perspective neglects an important insight provided by narrative theory as applied in the cognitive sciences and other practical fields: human cognition is organized around specific narrative structures. In adaptation, this means that how we 'story' the environment determines how we understand and practice adaptation, how risks are defined, who is authorized as actors in the change debate, and the range of policy options considered. Furthermore, relating an experience through story-telling is already doing 'knowledge work', or learning. In taking narrative beyond its use as an extractive social research methodology, we argue that narrative research offers an innovative, holistic approach to a better understanding of socio-ecological systems and the improved, participatory design of local adaptation policies. Beyond producing data on local knowledge(s) and socio-cultural and affective-emotive factors influencing adaptive capacity, it can significantly inform public engagement, deliberation and learning strategies-features of systemic adaptive governance. We critically discuss narrative as both a self-reflective methodology and as a paradigmatic shift in future adaptation research and practice. We explore the narrative approach as a basis for participatory learning in the governance of socio-ecological systems. Finally, we assemble arguments for investing in alternative governance approaches consistent with a shift to a 'narrative paradigm'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

76,Women and water management in times of climate change: participatory and inclusive processes,2013-01-01,"This paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

78,"Priming the Governance System for Climate Change Adaptation: The Application of a Social-Ecological Inventory to Engage Actors in Niagara, Canada",2014-01-01,"Climate change adaptation presents a challenge to current top-down governance structures, including the tension between provision of public goods and actions required by diverse stakeholders, including private actors. Alternative governance approaches that facilitate participation and learning across scales are gaining attention for their ability to bring together diverse actors across sectors and to foster adaptive capacity and resilience. We have described the method and outcomes from the application of a social-ecological inventory to ""prime,"" i.e., hasten the development of, a regional climate change adaptation network. The social-ecological inventory tool draws on the social-ecological systems approach in which social and ecological systems are considered linked. The tool bridges the gap between conventional stakeholder analysis and biological inventories, drawing on a social-ecological systems approach, and incorporates local knowledge as an explicit component. The process, which is dynamic and iterative, includes six phases: preparations, preliminary identification, identification of key individuals, interviewing, reviewing and enriching the inventory, and engagement. By considering the social and ecological aspects of a system, a more comprehensive inventory is achieved that provides a foundational platform to facilitate or support climate change adaptation processes that are participatory and learning oriented. Although social-ecological inventories have been used for ecosystem management, the intent of this research was to understand the potential of the tool for climate change adaptation. A social-ecological inventory was undertaken in the Niagara Region of Canada to assemble and facilitate a regional governance group to champion climate change adaptation. Moreover, the social-ecological inventory was purposefully undertaken as the initial step in priming the governance system and led into an adaptive comanagement process for climate change adaptation. Early indicators suggest that the social-ecological inventory has been instrumental in facilitating a multisectoral adaptive comanagement governance approach to climate change in the Niagara Region.",292,present challenge current top governance structure including tension provision good action required diverse stakeholder including private actor alternative governance approach facilitate participation learning across scale gaining attention ability bring together diverse actor across sector foster adaptive capacity resilience described method outcome application social ecological inventory prime e hasten development regional network social ecological inventory tool draw social ecological system approach social ecological system considered linked tool bridge gap conventional stakeholder analysis biological inventory drawing social ecological system approach incorporates local knowledge explicit component process dynamic iterative includes six phase preparation preliminary identification identification key individual interviewing reviewing enriching inventory considering social ecological aspect system comprehensive inventory achieved provides foundational platform facilitate support process participatory learning oriented although social ecological inventory used ecosystem management intent research understand potential tool social ecological inventory undertaken niagara region canada assemble facilitate regional governance group champion moreover social ecological inventory purposefully undertaken initial step priming governance system led adaptive comanagement process early indicator suggest social ecological inventory instrumental facilitating multisectoral adaptive comanagement governance approach niagara region

80,Using social representations theory to make sense of climate change: what scientists and nonscientists in Australia think,2014-01-01,"The mass media has ensured that the challenging and complex phenomenon of climate change now has the household familiarity of a brand name. But what is it that is understood by climate change, and by whom? What frame of reference is drawn upon to communicate meaningfully about climate change? Do particular subgroups within our society hold different understandings, or have the debate and the prolific dissemination of information about this issue coalesced around a core perception or image of what climate change is? To answer these questions, we conceptualized climate change within the theory of social representations as emergent socially constructed knowledge. We analyzed word association data collected in Australia from persons identifying as having a scientific, government, or general public background (N = 3300). All respondents were asked to write the first words that came to mind when they thought about climate change. Comparative analyses of the word associations reveal that respondents from different backgrounds define climate change in different ways. The results suggest that there is a common core set of concepts shared by the different groups, but there are also a great many differences in how climate change is framed and conceived by respondents. The results are discussed in relation to what they imply for responses to climate change by these social groups and in relation to interventions designed to encourage climate adaptation.",226,mass medium ensured challenging complex phenomenon household familiarity brand name understood frame reference drawn upon communicate meaningfully particular subgroup within society hold different understanding debate prolific dissemination information issue coalesced around core perception image answer question conceptualized within theory social representation emergent socially constructed knowledge analyzed word association data collected australia person identifying scientific government general background n respondent asked write first word came mind thought comparative analysis word association reveal respondent different background define different way result suggest common core set concept shared different group great many difference framed conceived respondent result discussed relation imply response social group relation intervention designed encourage
81,Meeting institutional criteria for social resilience: a nested risk system model,2014-01-01,"Communities of Alaska's North Slope face increased stresses from cumulative effects of industrial development, resource use, and changing cryospheric and socioeconomic conditions. Given these multiple pressures, what avenues exist for citizens and decision makers to exchange knowledge about impacts of oil resource extraction in Alaska, and how do the successes and failures of knowledge exchange affect the resilience of the local social ecological system? We focused our research on the risk management process of Alaska North Slope oil resources, drawing on literature that has grown out of the risk society thesis and concepts of resilience science. We surveyed state and federal initiatives designed to increase local and indigenous stakeholder engagement in science and policy issues because such guidelines and regulations impact on the abilities of local peoples and communities to adapt sustainability strategies. Perceived risks and desired outcomes of stakeholders on the front lines of climate change and resource development should inform regulations that aim to anticipate future impacts and needed adaptation strategies. Integration of local values and perceptions in an adaptive risk management approach is fundamental in resilience-based ecosystem stewardship. The three case studies we have presented show that current provisions fail to equitably include the local and indigenous knowledge of Alaska's North Slope Borough communities in environmental risk mediation in proportion to the scope of risks inherent in current oil development policies.

On the basis of interview data from four employees of a large retail organization, this paper employs an ideographic case-study approach to illustrate how the processes linking job characteristics to job-related strain and well-being (e.g. appraisal, action regulation, coping, resource utilization) unfold within four individual workers, as they attempt to manage perceived increases in demands resulting from staff cuts. We highlight the importance that these employees place on their own psychological resources (e.g. self-efficacy) and coping mechanisms (e.g. disengagement) in dealing with these changes, as well as how the perceived availability or absence of job resources (e.g. social support, decision authority, organizational justice) influences their ability to cope with increased demands. We use the insights gained from the case studies to illustrate the value of integrating multiple theoretical perspectives towards achieving a nuanced understanding of the intricacies involved in these experiences and to suggest ways in which the coping capacities of individual employees might be increased.

85,"Assessing the vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to sea level rise using multi-criteria analysis in Scarborough, Maine (USA)",2014-01-01,"Sea level rise and climate change will have widespread impacts on coastal towns and cities, many of which have seen dramatic increases in development over recent decades. In addition to potential private property damage, the critical public infrastructure that supports these regions will become increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding. This paper describes a straightforward, structured methodology for identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities in the coastal community of Scarborough, Maine, USA. The study uses GIS mapping and analysis techniques to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities in a coastal town under three different potential future flooding scenarios. A simple multi-criteria analysis matrix is used to explore the often hard to quantify, multifaceted consequences of infrastructure loss. Numerical scores are attributed to represent the economic, social, health and safety and environmental impacts of coastal flooding, allowing vulnerable locations to be ranked in order of overall importance. The results are summarized in a series of tables, maps and data sheets that convey data in readily accessible formats. High traffic roads, including evacuation routes, and major utility corridors are identified as the most critical vulnerable infrastructure assets in the town. Targeted improvements are recommended in these critical areas to improve system and community resilience to climate change and sea level rise. Our approach makes use of standard techniques, requires limited data and is therefore readily transferable for use in infrastructure planning in other similar communities. The methodology encourages public engagement and education, and the results can be used by the local authorities to pursue external funding opportunities to support investment in proactive infrastructure adaptation. The identification of key system weaknesses will allow future infrastructure investment to be targeted to the most critical areas, and assist in improving emergency response plans.

86,Encountering climate change: 'seeing' is more than 'believing',2014-01-01,"Individuals' direct exposure to and experience of climate change are arguably integral aspects of their risk perceptions, understandings, and engagement with the issue. Recent research investigating these experiences has thrown into sharp relief some fundamental considerations with respect to public risk perceptions and responses, in particular the extent to which such perceived encounters might reflect a priori beliefs and motivated reasoning. Findings to date are intriguing and compelling, both in regard to the escalating percentages of individuals who report having such personal encounters, and conclusions being drawn with respect to the nature, significance, and influence of such direct experience. These findings have also led to some intuitively reasonable but possibly problematic recommendations regarding policy and issue and behavioural engagement implications. A focus on underlying processes of experience and belief, oversimplified in terms of 'seeing' or 'believing', has however deflected attention from other issues such as the nature and contexts of individual climate change encounters, the clarity of the constructs and validity of the measures being used for 'belief' and 'experience', and the transactional and phenomenological nature of climate change encounters. There is nonetheless current and convergent evidence that perceived direct experience of environmental changes or events deemed to be manifestations of climate change influences psychological responses such as risk perception, acceptance, belief certainty, distress, and psychological and behavioural adaptation. These findings suggest that such experiences, for many, foster a contextualized and more personally meaningful realisation of what climate change portends, implies, and ultimately means, locally and globally.

87,Proximity to Coast Is Linked to Climate Change Belief,2014-01-01,"Psychologists have examined the many psychological barriers to both climate change belief and concern. One barrier is the belief that climate change is too uncertain, and likely to happen in distant places and times, to people unlike oneself. Related to this perceived psychological distance of climate change, studies have shown that direct experience of the effects of climate change increases climate change concern. The present study examined the relationship between physical proximity to the coastline and climate change belief, as proximity may be related to experiencing or anticipating the effects of climate change such as sea-level rise. We show, in a national probability sample of 5,815 New Zealanders, that people living in closer proximity to the shoreline expressed greater belief that climate change is real and greater support for government regulation of carbon emissions. This proximity effect held when adjusting for height above sea level and regional poverty. The model also included individual differences in respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth. The results indicate that physical place plays a role in the psychological acceptance of climate change, perhaps because the effects of climate change become more concrete and local.",191,psychologist examined many psychological barrier belief concern barrier belief uncertain likely happen distant place time people unlike oneself related perceived psychological distance study direct experience effect increase concern present examined relationship physical proximity coastline belief proximity may related experiencing anticipating effect sea level rise national probability sample zealander people living closer proximity shoreline expressed greater belief real greater support government regulation carbon emission proximity effect held adjusting height sea level regional poverty model included individual difference respondent sex age education political orientation wealth result indicate physical place play role psychological acceptance perhaps effect become concrete local
88,Motivating mitigation: when health matters more than climate change,2014-01-01,"The US public consistently ranks climate change as a low national priority due, in part, to a lack of personal engagement and a sense of temporal and spatial distance from the environmental effects (Leiserowitz 2006). Yet, the chief method for climate change mitigation, the reduction of fossil fuel use, would also reduce particulate air pollution, which is implicated in over three million deaths worldwide each year (Lim et al. 2013). Indeed, in the US, improved public health ranks among the top perceived benefits of reducing fossil fuel use (Leiserowitz et al. 2013), and the scientific community has been promoting these benefits-such as reduction in hospitalizations and premature deaths -for over a decade (Cifuentes et al. 2001; West et al. 2013). Furthermore, the health behavior literature demonstrates that personal perception of risk, which is likely to be linked to health, is one of the strongest motivators of behavioral change (Few 2007; Maibach and Parrott 1995). Thus, one possible method for garnering support for carbon emissions reduction is to emphasize the added co-benefit of reducing present-day, health-related impacts. However, it remains to be understood whether public health messaging can lead to improved climate change mitigation efforts, or how specific segments of the US population will respond to this message. In particular, emphasizing health co-benefits may be a strong motivator of attitude change among individuals who are less concerned about environmental threats or who deny the existence of anthropogenic climate change.",238,u consistently rank low national priority due part lack personal sense temporal spatial distance environmental effect leiserowitz yet chief method mitigation reduction fossil fuel use would reduce particulate air pollution implicated three million death worldwide year lim et al indeed u improved health rank among top perceived benefit reducing fossil fuel use leiserowitz et al scientific community promoting benefit reduction hospitalization premature death decade cifuentes et al west et al furthermore health behavior literature demonstrates personal perception risk likely linked health strongest motivator behavioral maibach parrott thus possible method garnering support carbon emission reduction emphasize added co benefit reducing present day health related impact however remains understood whether health messaging lead improved mitigation effort specific segment u population respond message particular emphasizing health co benefit may strong motivator attitude among individual le concerned environmental threat deny existence anthropogenic
89,Reframing the Climate Change Debate to Better Leverage Policy Change: An Analysis of Public Opinion and Political Psychology,2014-01-01,"U.S. climate change-related policy response is failing, despite scientific consensus on core realities, in part because of comprehensive, simultaneous, yet incommensurable doctrines and political biases. Climate disruption is a critically important agenda for homeland security and emergency management, yet as framed today, the policy communication regime frequently requires many skeptics or deniers to abandon their opinions, cultural commitments and epistemic frameworks. Public opinion consensus would be optimal, but the traditional education/information approach is flawed, and continued delays in significant mitigation and adaptation policy implementation will mean far larger future costs to protect civilian environmental security and national interests. Thus, effective response demands new messaging strategies, pursuing interim progress, leveraging overlapping consensus, enhancing risk analysis literacy, and constructing alternative, intermediary categories of multiple parallel discourse. These framings would center on security, economic interests, public health, religious stewardship, and other themes. Customized audience discourses may enable better public and opinion leader buy-in, partly transcending polarization, since such leaders have a unique ability to help translate and promote these various discourses. In addition, eventual construction of a multi-dimensional map could optimize effective messaging and supportive coalitions.

The purpose of this study was to assess the perception towards climate change, behavior change, mitigation and adaptation measures issued by the central government among the health professionals in the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in China. Methods: In 2013, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken among 314 CDC health professionals in various levels of CDC in Shanxi Province, China. Descriptive analyses were performed. Results: More than two thirds of the respondents believed that climate change has happened at both global and local levels, and climate change would lead to adverse impacts to human beings. Most respondents (74.8%) indicated the emission of greenhouse gases was the cause of climate change, however there was a lack of knowledge about greenhouse gases and their sources. Media was the main source from which respondents obtained the information about climate change. A majority of respondents showed that they were willing to change behavior, but their actions were limited. In terms of mitigation and adaptation measures issued by the Chinese Government, respondents' perception showed inconsistency between strategies and relevant actions. Moreover, although the majority of respondents believed some strategies and measures were extremely important to address climate change, they were still concerned about economic development, energy security, and local environmental protection. Conclusion: There are gaps between perceptions and actions towards climate change among these health professionals. Further efforts need to be made to raise the awareness of climate change among health professionals, and to promote relevant actions to address climate change in the context of the proposed policies with local sustainable development.

91,Understanding Corn Belt farmer perspectives on climate change to inform engagement strategies for adaptation and mitigation,2014-01-01,"Development of extension and outreach that effectively engage farmers in climate change adaptation and/or mitigation activities can be informed by an improved understanding of farmers' perspectives on climate change and related impacts. This research employed latent class analysis (LCA) to analyze data from a survey of 4,778 farmers from 11 US Corn Belt states. The research focused on two related research questions: (1) to what degree do farmers differ on key measures of beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks to agriculture, efficacy, and level of support for public and private adaptive and mitigative action; and (2) are there potential areas of common ground among farmers? Results indicate that farmers have highly heterogeneous perspectives, and six distinct classes of farmers are identified. We label these as the following: the concerned (14%), the uneasy (25%), the uncertain (25%), the unconcerned (13%), the confident (18%), and the detached (5%). These groups of farmers differ primarily in terms of beliefs about climate change, the degree to which they had experienced extreme weather, and risk perceptions. Despite substantial differences on these variables, areas of similarity were discerned on variables measuring farmers' (1) confidence that they will be able to deal with increases in weather variability and (2) support for public and private efforts to help farmers adapt to increased weather variability. These results can inform segmented approaches to outreach that target subpopulations of farmers as well as broader engagement strategies that would reach wider populations. Further, findings suggest that strategies with specific reference to climate change might be most effective in engaging the subpopulations of farmers who believe that climate change is occurring and a threat, but that use of less charged terms such as weather variability would likely be more effective with a broader range of farmers. Outreach efforts that (1) appeal to farmers' problem solving capacity and (2) employ terms such as ""weather variability"" instead of more charged terms such as ""climate change"" are more likely to be effective with a wider farmer audience.",335,development extension outreach effectively engage farmer mitigation activity informed improved understanding farmer perspective related impact research employed latent class analysis lca analyze data survey farmer u corn belt state research focused related research question degree farmer differ key measure belief experience extreme weather perceived risk agriculture efficacy level support private adaptive mitigative action potential area common ground among farmer result indicate farmer highly heterogeneous perspective six distinct class farmer identified label following concerned uneasy uncertain unconcerned confident detached group farmer differ primarily term belief degree experienced extreme weather risk perception despite substantial difference variable area similarity discerned variable measuring farmer confidence able deal increase weather variability support private effort help farmer adapt increased weather variability result inform segmented approach outreach target subpopulation farmer well broader strategy would reach wider population finding suggest strategy specific reference might effective engaging subpopulation farmer believe occurring threat use le charged term weather variability would likely effective broader range farmer outreach effort appeal farmer problem solving capacity employ term weather variability instead charged term likely effective wider farmer audience
92,"Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses",2014-01-01,"Climate change impacts on marine environments have been somewhat neglected in climate change research, particularly with regard to their social dimensions and implications. This paper contributes to addressing this gap through presenting a UK focused mixed-method study of how publics frame, understand and respond to marine climate change-related issues. It draws on data from a large national survey of UK publics (N = 1,001), undertaken in January 2011 as part of a wider European survey, in conjunction with in-depth qualitative insights from a citizens' panel with participants from the East Anglia region, UK. This reveals that discrete marine climate change impacts, as often framed in technical or institutional terms, were not the most immediate or significant issues for most respondents. Study participants tended to view these climate impacts 'in context', in situated ways, and as entangled with other issues relating to marine environments and their everyday lives. Whilst making connections with scientific knowledge on the subject, public understandings of marine climate impacts were mainly shaped by personal experience, the visibility and proximity of impacts, sense of personal risk and moral or equity-based arguments. In terms of responses, study participants prioritised climate change mitigation measures over adaptation, even in high-risk areas. We consider the implications of these insights for research and practices of public engagement on marine climate impacts specifically, and climate change more generally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

93,How are householders talking about climate change adaptation?,2014-01-01,"Given the wealth of information and research on the roles and responsibilities of the general public in climate mitigation, the lack of engagement of householders on climate adaptation is notable by its absence. As climate change impacts vary with locality, local adaption is important; however there are few processes that build awareness and engagement of householders with climate adaptation and planning. Using reports of discussions from 96 groups convened as part of a climate change engagement program called Energymark; this paper explores the concerns of householders around climate change and provides a lay perspective on climate adaptation. Analyses of group discussions reveal that householders were unable to readily distinguish between climate adaptation and mitigation actions. Groups discussed how they could increase local adaptive capacity through active citizenship and community action. This applied research provides empirical evidence of how deliberation can build social capital and contribute to local adaptive solutions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

94,Making it personal: Diversity and deliberation in climate adaptation planning,2015-01-01,"The vulnerabilities and health burdens of climate change fall disproportionately upon lower income communities and communities of color. Yet the very groups who are most affected by climate change impacts are least likely to be involved in climate adaptation discussions. These communities face critical barriers to involvement including historical disenfranchisement, as well as a sense that climate change is distant and not personally relevant. Boundary organizations are increasingly playing an important role in bringing science to bear on policy decision-making with respect to climate change adaptation, an issue fraught with political and ideological tensions. Our project aimed to engage underrepresented communities in climate change adaptation decision-making using a neighborhood consensus conference model developed and tested in several diverse districts of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Our partnership, a ""linked chain'' of boundary organizations, devised a neighborhood consensus conference model to present best-available climate data as tangible, place-based scenarios. In so doing, we made climate change ""personal'' for those who remain outside of climate change planning discourses and opened an opportunity for them to assess their community's vulnerabilities and communicate their priorities for public investment. Our neighborhood-based model built trust and social capital with local residents and allowed us to bring new voices into conversations around climate change adaptation concerns and priorities.

While this might imply that adaptation would be straightforward, extensive public and private investments, as well as many traditional MAori assets and cultural values, are in areas increasingly at risk of flooding and sea level rise. In order to consider the country's adaptive capacity in more detail, we have used an empirical research approach, working with government practitioners at three levels and with MAori communities. Very different perceptions of risk, and structural inertia in planning processes have emerged as key issues for implementing adaptation responses. In particular, the use of static frameworks biases responses towards retrospective, rather than anticipatory analysis. Ongoing socioeconomic changes in New Zealand also raise the risk of structural effects caused by climate change impacts becoming unevenly distributed across society. Our analysis indicates that a national and regional strategic approach, centred on a dynamic view of climate risk, is necessary for effective decisions at the local government and community level. In addition, effective adaptation requires better identification of barriers and opportunities for addressing changing risk, together with more effective and continuous social engagement.",204,future change zealand expected le many country zealand well established governance structure dealing environmental risk might imply would straightforward extensive private investment well many traditional maori asset cultural value area increasingly risk flooding sea level rise order consider country adaptive capacity detail used empirical research approach working government practitioner three level maori community different perception risk structural inertia planning process emerged key issue implementing response particular use static framework bias response towards retrospective rather anticipatory analysis ongoing socioeconomic change zealand raise risk structural effect caused impact becoming unevenly distributed across society analysis indicates national regional strategic approach centred dynamic view risk necessary effective decision local government community level addition effective requires better identification barrier opportunity addressing changing risk together effective continuous social
96,A framework for examining adaptation readiness,2015-01-01,"Adaptation readiness is proposed as a complimentary concept to adaptive capacity that captures the strength and existence of governance structures and policy processes which determine whether adaptation takes place. As such, adaptation readiness is concerned with examining actual experiences with planning for adaptation and seeks to characterize whether human systems are prepared and ready to 'do adaptation.' We propose a framework for evaluating readiness, identifying 6 overarching factors essential for adaptation taking place: political leadership, institutional organization, adaptation decision making and stakeholder engagement, availability of usable science, funding for adaptation, and public support for adaptation. For each readiness factor we identify potential indicators, data sources, and considerations for analysis, outlining approaches for quantitative scoring and qualitative examination. We briefly illustrate application of the framework using an example from the territory of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic, a region projected to experience some of the most dramatic changes in climate globally this century. The framework provides a systematic approach for assessing adaptation readiness, and can be used - in combination with other approaches - to inform the identification and prioritization of adaptation support, guide resources to areas where need is greatest, and serve as a proxy for adaptation tracking.",198,readiness proposed complimentary concept adaptive capacity capture strength existence governance structure policy process determine whether take place readiness concerned examining actual experience planning seek characterize whether human system prepared ready propose framework evaluating readiness identifying overarching factor essential taking place political leadership institutional organization decision making stakeholder availability usable science funding support readiness factor identify potential indicator data source consideration analysis outlining approach quantitative scoring qualitative examination briefly illustrate application framework example territory nunavut canadian arctic region projected experience dramatic change globally century framework provides systematic approach assessing readiness used combination approach inform identification prioritization support guide resource area need greatest serve proxy tracking
97,Monitored versus experience-based perceptions of environmental change: evidence from coastal Tanzania,2015-01-01,"The impacts of climate change are likely to exacerbate many problems that coastal areas already face. In this study, we used multinomial logistic regression to examine human perception of climate change based on a cross-sectional survey of 1253 individuals in coastal regions of Tanzania. This was complemented with time series analysis of 50-year meteorological data. The results indicate that self-rated ability to handle work pressure, self-rated ability to handle personal pressure and unexpected difficulties, age, region and educational status were significant predictors of perceived temperature change unlike ethnicity and gender. A disproportionately large percentage of respondents of all ages indicated that temperature was getting hotter between the past 10 and 30 years. This observation was supported by the time series analysis. Although respondents also alluded to changes in rainfall patterns in the past 10-30 years, time series analysis of rainfall revealed a different scenario except for Mtwara region of Tanzania. Because there is agreement between respondents' perceptions of temperature and available scientific climatic evidence over the 50-year period, this study argues that when meteorological records are incomplete or unavailable, local perceptions of climatic changes can be used to complement scientific climatic evidence.

Despite this, categories in climate politics remain caught up in the concepts of the 'science wars', rarely progressing far beyond the denier/believer-dichotomy. This article aims to nudge climate politics beyond the polarized scientific debates while also counteracting the de-politicisation that comes from assuming scientific claims lead directly to certain policies. First existing typologies of climate political positions are reviewed. Diverse contributions make up an emerging field of 'climate politology' but these tend to reduce climate politics either to views on the science or to products of cultural world-views. Drawing on policy analysis literature, a new approach is outlined, where problem-definitions and solution-framings provide the coordinates for a two-dimensional grid. The degree to which climate change is considered a 'wicked' problem on the one hand, and individualist or collectivist ways of understanding political agency on the other, provide a map of climate political positions beyond 'believers' vs 'deniers'.

100,Informed adaptation: Ethical considerations for adaptation researchers and decision-makers,2015-01-01,"Given the significant and irreversible impacts of climate change on communities and the environment, there is increasing focus on how to best support decision-makers to adapt to climate change. Generally, the research on this tends to focus on assessing how decision-makers navigate elements of risk and uncertainty in deciding to what extent they should adapt their practice if at all, however, scientific researchers also have a key role to play in supporting these adaptation decisions. Given the applied nature of adaptation research, we argue that an examination of the roles and responsibilities of researchers is critical to understanding the ethical aspects of professional research practice in the adaptation context. This includes identifying how researchers can best support adaptation, and exploring the responsibilities that researchers have, not only to decision-makers but also to the broader membership of the adaptation community. In this paper we examine the ethical responsibility of researchers in supporting decision-makers to adapt to climate change, using agricultural producers as a case-study and focal group. Specifically, in undertaking this examination of risk and responsibility in adaptation research and decision-making, we use the lens of professional ethics to outline how research might better contribute to informed adaptation. We argue that clarifying the distinction between the research and operational aspects of agricultural adaptation, and how the interface between the two is disclosed, is critical. We also describe and explore the ethical considerations of researchers associated with stakeholder engagement in relation to adaptation science, and identify the need for institutional innovation for more effective engagement. In doing so, we seek to demonstrate how ethical research practice can support greater alignment of science and public values in agricultural adaptation, thus increasing the likely success of decisions.

101,"Adapting transportation to climate change on federal lands in Washington State, USA",2015-01-01,"Research scientists collaborated with federal land managers of two national parks and two national forests to conduct a climate change vulnerability assessment and to identify adaptation strategies for a transportation network covering 28,900 km of roads and trails in north-central Washington, U.S.A. The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement.

102,The dynamics of vulnerability: why adapting to climate variability will not always prepare us for climate change,2015-01-01,"Recent reports and scholarship suggest that adapting to current climate variability may represent a no regrets' strategy for adapting to climate change. Addressing adaptation deficits' and other approaches that target existing vulnerabilities are helpful for responding to current climate variability, but we argue that they may not be sufficient for adapting to climate change. Through a review and unique synthesis of the natural hazards and climate adaptation literatures, we identify why the dynamics of vulnerability matter for adaptation efforts. We draw on vulnerability theory and the natural hazards and climate adaptation literatures to outline how adaptation to climate variability, combined with the shifting societal landscape can sometimes lead to unintended consequences and increased vulnerability. Moreover, we argue that public perceptions of risk associated with current climate variability do not necessarily position communities to adapt to the impacts from climate change. We suggest that decision makers faced with adapting to climate change must consider the dynamics of vulnerability in a connected systemhow choices made in one part of the system might impact other valued outcomes or even create new vulnerabilities. We conclude by suggesting the need for greater engagement with various publics on the tradeoffs involved in adaptation action and for improving communication about the complicated nature of the dynamics of vulnerability.

104,Integrating the effects of flood experience on risk perception with responses to changing climate risk,2014-01-01,"Flood management decision-makers face significant challenges as the climate changes. The perceptions of those affected by floods are critical to the successful implementation of adaptation responses; risk perceptions are affected by how information is communicated and, in turn, perceptions influence expectations on flood risk managers to respond. The links between flood experience, risk perception, and responses by individual households were examined in the Hutt Valley, New Zealand, through a household survey, a workshop and interviews with local government practitioners. Two propositions were tested: (1) that flood experience can influence flood risk perceptions; and (2) that flood experience can stimulate increased risk reduction and adaptation actions where changing climate risk is likely. Perceptions of responsibility for flood management were also examined. The study found that previous flood experience contributes to heightened perception of risk, increased preparedness of households, greater willingness to make household-level changes, greater communication with councils, and more advocacy for spatial planning to complement existing structural protection. Flood-affected households had a stronger preference for central government and communities having flood risk responsibilities, in addition to local government. Those who lacked experience were more likely to be normalised to their prior benign experiences and thus optimistic about flood consequences. These results suggest that harnessing positive aspects of experience and communication of changing risk through engagement strategies could help shift the focus from citizens' expectation that governments will always provide protection, to a citizen-local government-central government dialogue about the changing character of flood risk and its implications, and build a 'risk conscious' society in which 'sharing and bearing' is considered desirable.",260,flood management decision maker face significant challenge change perception affected flood critical successful implementation response risk perception affected information communicated turn perception influence expectation flood risk manager respond link flood experience risk perception response individual household examined hutt valley zealand household survey workshop interview local government practitioner proposition tested flood experience influence flood risk perception flood experience stimulate increased risk reduction action changing risk likely perception responsibility flood management examined found previous flood experience contributes heightened perception risk increased preparedness household greater willingness make household level change greater communication council advocacy spatial planning complement existing structural protection flood affected household stronger preference central government community flood risk responsibility addition local government lacked experience likely normalised prior benign experience thus optimistic flood consequence result suggest harnessing positive aspect experience communication changing risk strategy could help shift focus citizen expectation government always provide protection local government central government dialogue changing character flood risk implication build risk conscious society sharing bearing considered desirable
105,"""There is nothing political in it"": triggers of local political leaders' engagement in climate adaptation",2015-01-01,"Local government is attributed a vital role in climate-change adaptation. Previous studies contend that conflicting priorities, insufficient institutional incentives and knowledge of risks, and inadequate resources all impede local climate adaptation. Though the importance of local political support in enabling climate adaptation is widely acknowledged, the views of local politicians have rarely been analysed. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with local politicians in Sweden, we explore what affects their engagement in climate adaptation. The study claims that climate adaptation contrary to mitigation is not viewed as political beyond directing attention and sanctioning guidelines set by officials. A limited number of interviewees claim a more strategic political role in adaptation. The combined effect of institutional incentives (e.g. fragmented national guidelines, unappealing goals, and lack of funding), relative weight in local politics, and ability to exercise political leadership (e.g. campaign value, public and media pressure, and lack of ideology) is perceived as too insignificant to trigger strong political engagement.

We investigate this for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) work stream on addressing loss and damage (L&D). This paper presents evidence of current engagement and expectations, from official submissions to the UNFCCC, L&D literature, and relates this to experiences from the fields of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). Results show a degree of 'vagueness' in outlining the role of the private sector with unclear conceptual boundaries of L&D, DRR and CCA posing challenges for stakeholders.

Scholarship on local adaptation policy has proliferated in recent years, but insufficient attention has been paid to operationalization of the unit of analysis, and methods employed are typically inadequate to draw inferences about variation across cases. This article seeks to contribute to the conceptual and methodological foundations of a research agenda for comparative analysis of local adaptation policies and policy-making. Synthesizing insights from policy studies literature and existing adaptation research, the article identifies and operationalizes two aspects of public policy policy content and policy process which are salient objects of comparative analysis that typically vary from one community to another.

110,"Aligning Climate Change Adaptation Planning with Adaptive Governance: Lessons from Exeter, NH",2015-01-01,"Adaptive governance has been recognized as an integrative approach for analyzing the social, institutional, ecologic, and economic aspects of decision-making to build resilience against climate change. Although closely aligned with adaptive co-management and ecosystem management, adaptive governance is a distinct framework that explicitly focuses on decentralized decision-making through social processes such as collaborative learning, networking, and the promotion of cross-sectoral partnerships to enhance adaptive capacity. In this paper, we explore an ongoing engagement process for climate change adaptation planning in Exeter, New Hampshire, and its alignment with key principles of adaptive governance. Climate change poses multiple challenges to Exeter, including increased flooding, reduced low flows, water quality degradation, and associated threats to estuarine ecosystems and public health. Engagement strategies include community conversations, workshops, experiential activities, and a community advisory board comprised of different stakeholder representatives (Citizens' Working Group) collaborating with the scientific team on water resources modeling and scenario analysis. We present important lessons about conveying expectations and timeframes of technical modeling to participants, developing multiple forums for interaction between researchers and other stakeholders, and making climate change locally relevant to residents by drawing connections to the community's experiences, cultural memory, values, and upcoming decisions. This study contributes to the literature on adaptive governance and climate change adaptation by evaluating stakeholder involvement in a local institutional setting, an important arena where adaptation decisions must be deliberated.

111,Developing rural community health risk assessments for climate change: a Tasmanian pilot study,2015-01-01,"Introduction: This article examines the development and pilot implementation of an approach to support local community decision-makers to plan health adaptation responses to climate change. The approach involves health and wellbeing risk assessment supported through the use of an electronic tool. While climate change is a major foreseeable public health threat, the extent to which health services are prepared for, or able to adequately respond to, climate change impact-related risks remains unclear. Building health decision-support mechanisms in order to involve and empower local stakeholders to help create the basis for agreement on these adaptive actions is an important first step. The primary research question was 'What can be learned from pilot implementation of a community health and well-being risk assessment (CHWRA) information technology-based tool designed to support understanding of, and decision-making on, local community challenges and opportunities associated with health risks posed by climate change?' Methods: The article examines the complexity of climate change science to adaptation translational processes, with reference to existing research literature on community development. This is done in the context of addressing human health risks for rural and remote communities in Tasmania, Australia. This process is further examined through the pilot implementation of an electronic tool designed to support the translation of physically based climate change impact information into community-level assessments of health risks and adaptation priorities. The procedural and technical nature of the CHWRA tool is described, and the implications of the data gathered from stakeholder workshops held at three rural Tasmanian local government sites are considered and discussed. Results: Bushfire, depression and waterborne diseases were identified by community stakeholders as being potentially 'catastrophic' health effects 'likely' to 'almost certain' to occur at one or more Tasmanian rural sites-based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change style of assessment. Consensus statements from stakeholders also suggested concern with regard to managing the ways that climate change can multiply socioeconomic and health outcome inequality. Above all, stakeholder responses emphasised the importance of an applied, complexity-oriented understanding of how climate and climate change impacts affect local communities and local services to compromise the overall quality of human health in these communities. Conclusions: Complex community-level assessments about climate change and related health risks and responses can be captured electronically in ways that offer potentially actionable information about priorities for health sector adaptation, as a first step in planning. What is valuable about these community judgements is the creation of shared values and commitments. Future iteration of the IT tool could include decision-support modules to support best practice health sector adaptation scenarios, providing participants with opportunities to develop their know-how about health sector adaptation to climate change. If managed carefully, such tools could work within a balanced portfolio of measures to help reduce the rising health burden from climate change.",460,introduction examines development pilot implementation approach support local community decision maker plan health response approach involves health wellbeing risk assessment supported use electronic tool major foreseeable health threat extent health service prepared able adequately respond impact related risk remains unclear building health decision support mechanism order involve empower local stakeholder help create basis agreement adaptive action important first step primary research question learned pilot implementation community health well risk assessment chwra information technology based tool designed support understanding decision making local community challenge opportunity associated health risk posed method examines complexity science translational process reference existing research literature community development done context addressing human health risk rural remote community tasmania australia process examined pilot implementation electronic tool designed support translation physically based impact information community level assessment health risk priority procedural technical nature chwra tool described implication data gathered stakeholder workshop held three rural tasmanian local government site considered discussed result bushfire depression waterborne disease identified community stakeholder potentially catastrophic health effect likely almost certain occur tasmanian rural site based intergovernmental panel style assessment consensus statement stakeholder suggested concern regard managing way multiply socioeconomic health outcome inequality stakeholder response emphasised importance applied complexity oriented understanding impact affect local community local service compromise overall quality human health community conclusion complex community level assessment related health risk response captured electronically way offer potentially actionable information priority health sector first step planning valuable community judgement creation shared value commitment future iteration tool could include decision support module support best practice health sector scenario providing participant opportunity develop know health sector managed carefully tool could work within balanced portfolio measure help reduce rising health burden
112,Public engagement and climate adaptation: insights from three local governments in Australia,2015-01-01,"Public participation in decision making is a central component of the planning process; however, implementing effective engagement initiatives to resolve complex planning and policy problems, such as climate change, is challenging for planners. These challenges are particularly acute in coastal communities throughout Australia, where many settlements are at risk of future climate perturbations. Using the International Association for Public Participation framework for public participation, we analyse three local government led public participation initiatives in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, Australia. Our analysis suggests there are three critical factors that can influence the level of public participation in the context of climate change adaptation: the technocratic approach to decision making; absent high order government support; and the lack of evaluation mechanisms for public participation.",124,participation decision making central component planning process however implementing effective initiative resolve complex planning policy problem challenging planner challenge particularly acute coastal community throughout australia many settlement risk future perturbation international association participation framework participation analyse three local government led participation initiative south wale victoria tasmania australia analysis suggests three critical factor influence level participation context technocratic approach decision making absent high order government support lack evaluation mechanism participation
113,Not a panacea: private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance in developing countries,2015-01-01,"The role of the private sector in climate finance is increasingly emphasized in international political debates. Knowledge of private engagement in mitigating climate change and in more advanced economies is growing, but the evidence base for private-sector engagement in climate change adaptation in developing countries remains weak. Starting from the premise that the private sector's role in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant, this article first analyses the potential of private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation financing in developing countries by conceptualizing the private sector's roles and motivation therein. For further inquiry, and for a discussion based on a developing-country context, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders for adaptation of Zambia's agricultural sector, including on ways in which the government can incentivize private-sector engagement in adaptation.How much private-sector adaptation and adaptation finance can be identified depends on the interpretation of the concept of adaptation. Under a broad interpretation, the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation, both directly and indirectly, through its investments and activities. However, the international private sector's role in financing adaptation should be analysed under a strict interpretation of adaptation and appears limited.Policy relevanceInternational political debates increasingly stress the importance of private climate finance, yet are constrained by vagueness around the private sector's role in adaptation finance. This article conceptualizes and scrutinizes private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance in developing countries. It concludes that the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation in direct and indirect ways, and that domestic policies incentivize such contributions. However, international private financing of adaptation is more limited and its analysis requires a stricter interpretation of adaptation. Private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation finance can supplement, but not substitute for, public investments in adaptation. These limitations are particularly important when discussing private adaptation finance as part of the developed countries' pledge to mobilize US$100 billion of climate finance per annum from 2020 onwards.",319,role private sector finance increasingly emphasized international political debate knowledge private mitigating advanced economy growing evidence base private sector developing country remains weak starting premise private sector role often inevitable potentially significant first analysis potential private sector financing developing country conceptualizing private sector role motivation therein inquiry discussion based developing country context interview conducted key stakeholder zambia agricultural sector including way government incentivize private sector much private sector finance identified depends interpretation concept broad interpretation domestic private sector particular contribute substantially directly indirectly investment activity however international private sector role financing analysed strict interpretation appears policy relevanceinternational political debate increasingly stress importance private finance yet constrained vagueness around private sector role finance conceptualizes scrutinizes private sector finance developing country concludes domestic private sector particular contribute substantially direct indirect way domestic policy incentivize contribution however international private financing analysis requires stricter interpretation private sector finance supplement substitute investment limitation particularly important discussing private finance part developed country pledge mobilize u billion finance per annum onwards
114,Making climate change visible: A critical role for landscape professionals,2015-01-01,"The central message of this essay is to make climate change more visible and meaningful to community members through landscape architectural techniques and building literacy. It identifies general principles for opening people's eyes to climate change, demonstrating the potentially powerful role that landscape can play in helping citizens to see and foresee climate change in their own backyards, where they care the most. In this context, the author emphasizes the value of local landscape & place-based experience, as well as the importance of designing visible solutions. The essay describes two linked frameworks that address respectively the possibility of seeing and recognizing climate change, and the need to consider not only climate change impacts but also its causes, mitigation and adaptation solutions. Landscape architects and landscape planners can play an integrative, educational & visionary role in creative design and engagement of communities on climate change. The essay offers four pathways for landscape professionals to integrate & enhance public engagement and literacy on climate change, through: applying landscape messaging to make climate change more visible on the ground; using compelling visual tools that reveal signs of climate change in local landscapes and depict resilient, low-carbon futures; local climate change visioning processes to help communities understand the implications for communities; and helping neighbours to self-educate and mobilize for local climate change action.

116,Climate-adaptive technological change in a small region: A resource-based scenario approach,2015-01-01,"Society at large must find technological pathways capable of mitigating climate change. But small regions - where private and public sector decision makers take actions whose aggregated effects shape those broader pathways - are faced with the need to adapt to climate impacts over which they have little control. Such impacts already include not only direct climatological ones, but also related systemic shifts in technologies, markets, and policies. Firms and policymakers can widen the range of adaptation opportunities by exploring regional resources applicable to emergent clusters, through which technologically related inter-organizational dynamics may permit more effective climate responses. As in the resource-based view of the firm underlying cluster theory, key decision fields are chosen based on existing capabilities internal to the region in relation to the threats and opportunities transmitted by external climate change impacts. Adaptive strategy options at the regional level can be identified and assessed using a scenario-building methodology that incorporates the interactions among multiple variables and decision-makers' actions over time. Stakeholder input and engagement during the research process can facilitate realism and traction.

117,Resilience projects as experiments: implementing climate change resilience in Asian cities,2015-01-01,"The capacity of actors and institutions to learn and reorganize is central to the resilience of complex systems, particularly in the context of rapidly urbanizing cities. A process of qualitative, reflective research among practitioners within the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) showed that development projects and programmes can contribute meaningfully to this capacity when they introduce projects as experiments. While projects did provide desired tangible benefits to certain groups of actors, many of the most significant contributions to resilience were related to knowledge, networks, information, and greater engagement of citizens with the state. This emphasis on the capacity to learn and reorganize provides a counterpoint to ideas around implementation and mainstreaming normally promoted within climate change adaptation practice - and, importantly, can help enrich these practices to maximize their effectiveness. This paper focuses on international development projects in particular, although findings have implications for other types of adaptation and resilience initiatives supported by governments, private sector, or community-based organizations.",161,capacity actor institution learn reorganize central resilience complex system particularly context rapidly urbanizing city process qualitative reflective research among practitioner within asian city resilience network acccrn showed development project programme contribute meaningfully capacity introduce project experiment project provide desired tangible benefit certain group actor many significant contribution resilience related knowledge network information greater citizen state emphasis capacity learn reorganize provides counterpoint idea around implementation mainstreaming normally promoted within practice importantly help enrich practice maximize effectiveness focus international development project particular although finding implication type resilience initiative supported government private sector community based organization
118,Climate change and Aotearoa New Zealand,2015-01-01,"With a population of 4.5 million, New Zealand's contribution to total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is relatively low. On a per capita basis, however, New Zealand's GHG emissions are the fifth highest among Annex 1 countries, due in part to the relative size of the pastoral agricultural sector. Biophysical impacts of climate change will largely extend current climate trends, with high regional variability. A review of climate change literature identifies three key risks for New Zealand relating to economic connectedness, perceptions of clean, green' New Zealand, and social equity. Since 2008, New Zealand's main mitigation response has been the emissions trading scheme (NZ ETS), yet the ETS is currently providing little by way of meaningful incentives for behavior change and low-carbon investment. Moreover, since declining to enter the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol, engagement with global climate governance has been modest, and recently released emissions reduction targets have raised questions over New Zealand's responsibilities as a global citizen. In this paper, adaptive responses are considered in connection to key industries (agriculture, tourism) and communities (coastal, Mori), and examine the devolved structure of adaptation. Mainstream media reporting of climate change in New Zealand appears to be aligned with the scientific consensus position, yet it continues to frame climate change as a political issue, prioritizing political over scientific voices. Public perceptions of climate change provide evidence of continued uncertainty relating to human attribution, and depict climate change as a spatially distanced risk which could affect support for government action on climate change.

119,"Improving Public Engagement With Climate Change: Five ""Best Practice"" Insights From Psychological Science",2015-01-01,"Despite being one of the most important societal challenges of the 21st century, public engagement with climate change currently remains low in the United States. Mounting evidence from across the behavioral sciences has found that most people regard climate change as a nonurgent and psychologically distant riskspatially, temporally, and sociallywhich has led to deferred public decision making about mitigation and adaptation responses. In this article, we advance five simple but important best practice insights from psychological science that can help governments improve public policymaking about climate change. Particularly, instead of a future, distant, global, nonpersonal, and analytical risk that is often framed as an overt loss for society, we argue that policymakers should (a) emphasize climate change as a present, local, and personal risk; (b) facilitate more affective and experiential engagement; (c) leverage relevant social group norms; (d) frame policy solutions in terms of what can be gained from immediate action; and (e) appeal to intrinsically valued long-term environmental goals and outcomes. With practical examples we illustrate how these key psychological principles can be applied to support societal engagement and climate change policymaking.",183,despite important societal challenge st century currently remains low united state mounting evidence across behavioral science found people regard nonurgent psychologically distant riskspatially temporally sociallywhich led deferred decision making mitigation response advance five simple important best practice insight psychological science help government improve policymaking particularly instead future distant global nonpersonal analytical risk often framed overt loss society argue policymakers emphasize present local personal risk b facilitate affective experiential c leverage relevant social group norm frame policy solution term gained immediate action e appeal intrinsically valued long term environmental goal outcome practical example illustrate key psychological principle applied support societal policymaking
120,Community engagement on adaptation: Meeting a growing capacity need,2015-01-01,"Climate change adaptation - to be politically feasible and socially acceptable - will not happen without broad public support. Yet, to date, the public has been barely engaged in finding effective solutions. Municipal and county staff, as well as community organizations that have taken the lead to date with climate planning, list building political and public support as one of the greatest barriers they face. As climate change impacts increase, and as adaptation measures move from the planning to the implementation stage, those affected by climate risks and adaptation strategies cannot be ignored. The community level is where climate change impacts manifest, where appropriate solutions are needed, and where synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, and between climate and nonclimate-policy choices play out. It is in specific locales where people live with the consequences of adaptation choices, and where a sense of place can be a motivation or hindrance to action. Local adaptation experts face a growing need to build capacity in effective stakeholder engagement in responding to climate impacts yet opportunities for doing so have been limited to date. This critical gap must be filled and training programs rapidly brought to scale for adaptation efforts to advance successfully. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Six forms of participation in urban adaptation are identified from the literature and the distinguishing characteristics and use of each type are examined across the cases. Few cases illustrate robust and sustained civic capacity in the governance of urban climate adaptation, although several cases reveal budding capacity that could emerge with further efforts to engage businesses and citizens in articulating priorities and strategies for future adaptation efforts.

122,"Preaching to different choirs: How to motivate dismissive, uncommitted, and alarmed audiences to adapt to climate change?",2016-01-01,"People vary considerably in terms of their knowledge, beliefs, and concern about climate change. Thus, an important challenge for climate change communicators is how to most effectively engage different types of audiences. This study aimed to identify distinct audience segments that vary in terms of their values, beliefs, and responses to climate change and determine for each segment which specific message attributes increased motivation to engage in climate adaptation. A sample of 1031 Australian residents (aged 18-66 years) completed an online survey assessing their values, beliefs, and behaviors related to climate change, and recording their responses to a broad range of climate change adaptation messages. Latent profile analysis identified three distinct audience segments: alarmed (34.4%), uncommitted (45.2%), and dismissive (20.3%). Sixty climate change adaptation messages were coded in terms of the presence/absence of six attributes: explicit reference to climate change, providing specific adaptation advice, strong negative emotive content, emphasis on collective responsibility, highlighting local impacts, and underscoring financial impacts. Participants viewed a random sample of six messages and rated the extent to which each message motivated them to seek out more information and immediately respond to the climate change threat portrayed in the message. Multilevel modeling indicated messages that included strong negative emotive content or provided specific adaptation advice increased adaptation intentions in all three audience segments. Omitting any mention of climate change and emphasizing local impacts increased adaptation intentions in dismissive audiences. Implications for tailoring and targeting climate change adaptation messages are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

123,Fostering Resilience in the Face of an Uncertain Future: Using Scenario Planning to Communicate Climate Change Risks and Collaboratively Develop Adaptation Strategies,2016-01-01,"Communicating about climate change is a serious challenge. There is an urgent need to develop effective processes at the local level to engage, inform, and support decision-makers in their efforts to plan for the impacts of climate change. This is particularly urgent in Alaska, where the impacts of climate change are already being felt. The Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks has spent the past 7 years facilitating the use of scenarios for climate change planning. In this case study highlighting SNAP's collaboration with the National Park Service (NPS), we explore how the scenario planning process can be applied to support effective communication of climate risks.

124,Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural and Forest Landscapes for Policy Development and Verification,2016-01-01,"The emergence of policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated a rapid shift in ecosystem modeling, especially concerning agricultural and forest management effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil carbon (C). First, we review models for estimating GHG fluxes in agricultural and forest landscapes. Second, we investigate the interplay of models with institutions that develop and implement climate change policy. Limited GHG flux observations constrain our understanding of process controls, especially with respect to N2O flux. Even when simulation models explicitly include N2O flux, this capability is infrequently applied or validated. In the policy arena, tools used to estimate aboveground forest biomass C rely on robust inventory data. Such data are scarce outside of the industrialized world. Compared with biomass C, soil C storage in both forest and agricultural systems is difficult to quantify. Widely used estimates depend on critical assumptions such as the extent to which erosion contributes to C loss from fields and the mechanisms by which C is stabilized in soil, both of which are the subject of serious debate. As evidenced by at least one instance we explore, institutions dedicated to policy development and implementation can rapidly achieve a nuanced understanding of these limitations, given sufficient engagement of the research community. Our review illuminates challenges that affect land-based GHG mitigation initiatives as a result of current knowledge gaps, institutional capacity, and decision-making frameworks. We suggest key points that should be communicated to model users and raise questions that could be fruitfully addressed by model developers and consumers of modeled estimates.",256,emergence policy reduce greenhouse gas ghg emission motivated rapid shift ecosystem modeling especially concerning agricultural forest management effect nitrous oxide n emission soil carbon c first review model estimating ghg flux agricultural forest landscape second investigate interplay model institution develop implement policy ghg flux observation constrain understanding process control especially respect n flux even simulation model explicitly include n flux capability infrequently applied validated policy arena tool used estimate aboveground forest biomass c rely robust inventory data data scarce outside industrialized world compared biomass c soil c storage forest agricultural system difficult quantify widely used estimate depend critical assumption extent erosion contributes c loss field mechanism c stabilized soil subject serious debate evidenced least instance explore institution dedicated policy development implementation rapidly achieve nuanced understanding limitation given sufficient research community review illuminates challenge affect land based ghg mitigation initiative current knowledge gap institutional capacity decision making framework suggest key point communicated model user raise question could fruitfully addressed model developer consumer modeled estimate
125,"Climate knowledge cultures: Stakeholder perspectives on change and adaptation in Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia",2016-01-01,"Effective climate adaptation requires engagement (awareness, motivation, and capacity to act) at relevant scales, from individuals to global institutions. In many parts of the world, research attention has focused on the engagement of the general public. We suggest that studies also need to focus on key stakeholders in the government and non-governmental sectors who participate in adaptation planning processes, so that a better understanding may be achieved of the distinct knowledge cultures that influence their engagement with climate change. Indonesia is a key actor in climate adaptation because of the potentially dire consequences for its population's livelihoods and well-being. In this paper we consider whether 'climate knowledge cultures' exist amongst stakeholders at multiple organisational levels in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) Province, Eastern Indonesia. Surveys were conducted with 124 stakeholders from differing levels at the beginning of four multi-stakeholder climate adaptation workshops. Questions elicited perceptions of their region's challenges, observation and awareness of climate change, feelings they associated with climate change, beliefs regarding causes, risks and preparedness for climate change, and timeframes they associated with the future. Across all levels, climate change ranked highest as the first challenge participants identified, followed by food security, but well-being ranked highest when the top three challenges were combined. Most participants believed climate change was happening, but those working at higher organisational levels were more likely to attribute climate change to human factors whereas those at lower levels were more likely to think it was a natural phenomenon. Women were in greater agreement and more optimistic than men about current government policies to cope with climate change. Perceptions differed between sub-districts, reflecting NTB's climatic diversity. We note that although climate change is an issue of concern among NTB stakeholders, the potential privileging of some knowledge cultures may lead to its association with cultural and political elitism. Second, climate change needs to be viewed alongside the myriad other challenges facing NTB, some of which have greater perceived immediacy. This analysis highlights the need for planning that can accommodate and integrate the diverse knowledge cultures and adaptation objectives that exist at multiple levels. (C) 2015 The Authors.

126,Online participation in climate change adaptation: A case study of agricultural adaptation measures in Northern Italy,2015-01-01,"The new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change suggests flexible and participatory approaches. Face-to-face contact, although it involves time-consuming procedures with a limited audience, has often been considered the most effective participatory approach. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in the visibility of different citizens' initiatives in the online world, which strengthens the possibility of greater citizen agency. This paper investigates whether the Internet can ensure efficient public participation with meaningful engagement in climate change adaptation. In elucidating issues regarding climate change adaptation, we developed an eParticipation framework to explore adaptation capacity of agriculture to climate change in Northern Italy. Farmers were mobilised using a pre-existing online network. First they took part in an online questionnaire for revealing their perceptions of and reactions to the impacts of ongoing changes in agriculture. We used these results to suggest a portfolio of policy measures and to set evaluation criteria. Farmers then evaluated these policy options, using a multi criteria analysis tool with a simple user-friendly interface. Our results showed that eParticipation is efficient; it supports a rapid data collection, while involving high number of participants. Moreover, we demonstrated that the digital divide is decreasingly an obstacle for using online spaces for public engagement. This research does not present eParticipation as a panacea. Rather, eParticipation was implemented with well-established participatory approaches to both validate the results and, consequently, communicate meaningful messages on local agricultural adaptation practices to regional decision-makers. Feedbacks from the regional decision-makers showed their interest in using eParticipation to improve communication with farmers in the future. We expect that, with further Internet proliferation, eParticipation may allow the inclusion of more representative samples, which would contribute to an informed and legitimate decision-making process.

127,Planning adaptation based on local actors' knowledge and participation: a climate governance experiment,2015-01-01,"Involving a wide-range of stakeholders at different moments in the planning of urban adaptation to climate change can help to overcome different barriers to adaptation, such as a lack of common perception, or control over options. This Article argues for an approach that involves a wide range of actors throughout the planning process in order to confront the challenges of urban adaptation to climate change. It builds on the results of a three-year participatory action research project to identify the catalysts with which local administrations can overcome the lack of data, the low level of engagement around the climate issue, and the cause-and-effect linkages of climate change impacts on the urban environment. Significant factors include territorial rootedness, leveraging actors' experience, interaction between actors, as well as the valuing of local actors as experts of territorial management rather than as novices with regard to climate change adaptation. In addition to contributing towards the engagement of a large number of stakeholders around adaptation issues, a planning process that involves representatives from various sectors and during several stages contributes to a greater understanding of these issues and their linkages. It follows that such a process will bring changes to urban practices by better articulating local concerns about climatic issues. Policy relevance Although participation is commonly advocated in policy responses to climate change, only few empirical studies have investigated the ways in which local actors' knowledge can be integrated into climate change adaptation planning processes. The article builds on the results of an action research project carried out in Quebec City, Canada, to address the relevance of involving a progressively broader range of actors as the adaptation process moves through its various phases. Given that a multitude of barriers to adaptation are at play at different times in a municipality, collaborations between local stakeholders emerge as a key factor. These collaborations provide greater insight into the linkages between climate change impacts and the urban environment and, in doing so, bring into question ordinary urban management and design practices.",334,involving wide range stakeholder different moment planning urban help overcome different barrier lack common perception control option argues approach involves wide range actor throughout planning process order confront challenge urban build result three year participatory action research project identify catalyst local administration overcome lack data low level around issue cause effect linkage impact urban environment significant factor include territorial rootedness leveraging actor experience interaction actor well valuing local actor expert territorial management rather novice regard addition contributing towards number stakeholder around issue planning process involves representative various sector several stage contributes greater understanding issue linkage follows process bring change urban practice better articulating local concern climatic issue policy relevance although participation commonly advocated policy response empirical study investigated way local actor knowledge integrated planning process build result action research project carried quebec city canada address relevance involving progressively broader range actor process move various phase given multitude barrier play different time municipality collaboration local stakeholder emerge key factor collaboration provide greater insight linkage impact urban environment bring question ordinary urban management design practice

This study contributes to public engagement debates by investigating engagement with climate change among an often overlooked group, the corporate middle class in Africa's second largest megacity, Lagos. Combining survey and interviews, I focus analysis on three aspects: awareness, knowledge and concern; role of scientific and social frames in shaping general attitude; and spatial attribution of causes and consequences. The study reveals a universal awareness and high concern about climate change among the respondents, although understanding and perceptions of climate change are significantly socially framed. Social situatedness, more than scientific facts, is the most important definer of overall engagement with climate change.

Here, using an unprecedented survey of 119 countries, we determine the relative influence of socio-demographic characteristics, geography, perceived well-being, and beliefs on public climate change awareness and risk perceptions at national scales. Worldwide, educational attainment is the single strongest predictor of climate change awareness. Understanding the anthropogenic cause of climate change is the strongest predictor of climate change risk perceptions, particularly in Latin America and Europe, whereas perception of local temperature change is the strongest predictor in many African and Asian countries. However, other key factors associated with public awareness and risk perceptions highlight the need to develop tailored climate communication strategies for individual nations.

130,Wildlife restoration: Mainstreaming translocations to keep common species common,2015-01-01,"In most urban and agricultural landscapes, remnants of native vegetation are surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities.

132,"Flood Risk Management as a public or a private good, and the implications for stakeholder engagement",2016-01-01,"A move to encourage partnership funding of Flood Risk Management (FRM) has resulted in current FRM measures providing both public and private benefits. Yet, the scales of service delivery associated with public and private goods are likely to influence the form and extent of public participation in FRM. We assess the range,of goods provided by FRM, whether these services are considered to be public in nature by authorities and citizens, and the impact this has upon the level and form of public engagement in FRM. We separate the definitions of public goods into 'pure' public goods which demonstrate characteristics of non-rivalry and non-excludability, and public priority goods which are services deemed as essential to public wellbeing regardless of characteristics. We find that English FRM delivers a range of public goods beyond that of reduced water flows, and that when FRM is considered a 'pure' public good the emergent form of public participation does not increase public awareness of flood risk or encourage investment in private protection measures. When the benefits of FRM are solely considered public priority goods public awareness of flood risk increases, yet disputes arise regarding service provision and maintenance. Importantly, increased flood risk from climate change or increased runoff could lead to the capacity of the public good provision being exceeded, leading to problems of distribution of that service, and reactionary pressure group formation. We argue that the current preference for public goods which reduce individual costs at the expense of public awareness can discourage adaptation, which may be problematic in ensuring sustainable FRM.

133,"Sustainable Development, Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Management",2016-01-01,"Climate change necessitates changes to the methods and procedures of disaster management. A triggering event results in disaster due to the severity of impacts and sequential, secondary consequences. These consequences result from factors such as the biophysical, social, political, economic, and structural context of the community experiencing the event. Climate change adds an additional progressive factor that increases the potential severity and frequency of triggering events and the vulnerability of communities experiencing the impact. Projecting future climate change impacts is imperfect, with a high degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty combined with the self-organizing, emergent properties that characterize urban systems, demands evaluation of the question, what qualifies as recovery? The manner in which policy is formulated must be adjusted to accommodate the dynamic contexts that may be subject to disaster triggering events. To address this need, disaster management must make adaptive capacity one of its primary goals. This is achieved through a process that combines risk assessment, comprehensive vulnerability assessment, iterative policy development and implementation, and ongoing public engagement. One of the critical aspects to long-term disaster recovery in the context of climate change is consideration of both local and regional contexts. Future adaptive capacity is closely tied with regional sustainability. This connection to sustainability is due to the fact that progressive climate change may further stress systems already being pushed by human development such as water and air pollution, habitat loss, and other degraded ecosystem services. Disaster events can result in the breaking of already stressed system connections. This confluence of events must be considered as part of disaster management. Further, ongoing monitoring of these systems and clear acknowledgement of their role in the ongoing functioning and vitality of a city is critical. Without continuous monitoring and iterative update of management procedures and local policy, communities will not be adequately prepared for an uncertain future.",305,necessitates change method procedure disaster management triggering event result disaster due severity impact sequential secondary consequence consequence factor biophysical social political economic structural context community experiencing event add additional progressive factor increase potential severity frequency triggering event vulnerability community experiencing impact projecting future impact imperfect high degree uncertainty uncertainty combined self organizing emergent property characterize urban system demand evaluation question qualifies recovery manner policy formulated must adjusted accommodate dynamic context may subject disaster triggering event address need disaster management must make adaptive capacity primary goal achieved process combine risk assessment comprehensive vulnerability assessment iterative policy development implementation ongoing critical aspect long term disaster recovery context consideration local regional context future adaptive capacity closely tied regional sustainability connection sustainability due fact progressive may stress system already pushed human development water air pollution habitat loss degraded ecosystem service disaster event breaking already stressed system connection confluence event must considered part disaster management ongoing monitoring system clear acknowledgement role ongoing functioning vitality city critical without continuous monitoring iterative update management procedure local policy community adequately prepared uncertain future
134,Earthquake risk communication as dialogue - insights from a workshop in Istanbul's urban renewal neighbourhoods,2016-01-01,"An important paradox of hazard communication is that the more effectively a potential physical threat is made public by the scientist, the more readily the scientific message becomes normalized into the daily discourses of ordinary life. As a result, a heightened risk awareness does not necessarily motivate personal or collective preparedness. If geoscientists are to help at-risk communities adopt meaningful measures to protect themselves, new strategies are needed for public communication and community engagement. This paper outlines an attempt to develop a novel approach to train geoscientists, using doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in an EU integrated training network studying tectonic processes and geohazards in Turkey. An urban field visit to seismically vulnerable neighbourhoods in Istanbul allowed the researchers to meet with local residents facing the seismic threat. Those meetings exposed the complex social, political and cultural concerns among Istanbul's at-risk urban communities. These concerns were used to provoke subsequent focus group discussions among the group of geoscientists about roles, responsibilities and methods of communicating hazard information to the public.

135,Achievable future conditions as a framework for guiding forest conservation and management,2016-01-01,"We contend that traditional approaches to forest conservation and management will be inadequate given the predicted scale of social-economic and biophysical changes in the 21st century. New approaches, focused on anticipating and guiding ecological responses to change, are urgently needed to ensure the full value of forest ecosystem services for future generations. These approaches acknowledge that change is inevitable and sometimes irreversible, and that maintenance of ecosystem services depends in part on novel ecosystems, i.e., species combinations with no analog in the past. We propose that ecological responses be evaluated at landscape or regional scales using risk-based approaches to incorporate uncertainty into forest management efforts with subsequent goals for management based on Achievable Future Conditions (AFC). AFCs defined at a landscape or regional scale incorporate advancements in ecosystem management, including adaptive approaches, resilience, and desired future conditions into the context of the Anthropocene. Inherently forward looking, ACFs encompass mitigation and adaptation options to respond to scenarios of projected future biophysical, social-economic, and policy conditions which distribute risk and provide diversity of response to uncertainty. The engagement of science-management-public partnerships is critical to our risk-based approach for defining AFCs. Robust monitoring programs of forest management actions are also crucial to address uncertainty regarding species distributions and ecosystem processes. Development of regional indicators of response will also be essential to evaluate outcomes of management strategies. Our conceptual framework provides a starting point to move toward AFCs for forest management, illustrated with examples from fire and water management in the Southeastern United States. Our model is adaptive, incorporating evaluation and modification as new information becomes available and as social-ecological dynamics change. It expands on established principles of ecosystem management and best management practices (BMPs) and incorporates scenarios of future conditions. It also highlights the potential limits of existing institutional structures for defining AFCs and achieving them. In an uncertain future of rapid change and abrupt, unforeseen transitions, adjustments in management approaches will be necessary and some actions will fail. However, it is increasingly evident that the greatest risk is posed by continuing to implement strategies inconsistent with current understanding of our novel future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

136,Outdoor Water Use as an Adaptation Problem: Insights from North American Cities,2016-01-01,"Recent efforts to influence the efficiency and timing of urban indoor water use through education, technology, conservation, reuse, economic incentives, and regulatory mechanisms have enabled many North American cities to accommodate population growth and buffer impacts of drought. It is unlikely that this approach will be equally successful into the future because the source of conservation will shift from indoor to outdoor use. Outdoor water is climate sensitive, difficult to measure, hard to predict, linked to other components of complex and dynamic urban resource systems, imbued with behavioral and cultural dimensions, and implicated in societal conflicts about climate risk, modern lifestyles, social justice, and future growth. Outdoor water conservation is not a traditional management problem focused on the water sector, assuming a stationary climate, and set aside from public debate. Instead, outdoor water is an adaptation problem, involving complex and uncertain system dynamics, the need for cross-sector coordination, strategies for dealing with climatic uncertainty, and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders with differing goals. This paper makes the case for treating outdoor water as an adaptation problem and offers a six-point strategy for how cities can better prepare their water systems for the uncertainties of climate and societal change.",197,recent effort influence efficiency timing urban indoor water use education technology conservation reuse economic incentive regulatory mechanism enabled many north american city accommodate population growth buffer impact drought unlikely approach equally successful future source conservation shift indoor outdoor use outdoor water sensitive difficult measure hard predict linked component complex dynamic urban resource system imbued behavioral cultural dimension implicated societal conflict risk modern lifestyle social justice future growth outdoor water conservation traditional management problem focused water sector assuming stationary set aside debate instead outdoor water problem involving complex uncertain system dynamic need cross sector coordination strategy dealing climatic uncertainty mechanism engaging stakeholder differing goal make treating outdoor water problem offer six point strategy city better prepare water system uncertainty societal
137,Private finance for adaptation: do private realities meet public ambitions?,2016-01-01,"The private sector's role in climate finance is increasingly subject to political and scientific debate. Yet there is poor empirical evidence of private engagement in adaptation and its potential contribution to the industrialised countries' mobilisation of USD 100 billion of annual climate finance from 2020 onwards to support developing countries to address climate change. This paper analysed 101 case studies of private sector adaptation under the Private Sector Initiative (PSI) of the UNFCCC Nairobi work programme, and examined these against ten 'adaptation finance criteria' that were distilled from UN climate negotiation outcomes. Results show that private adaptation interventions complement public adaptation activities. Yet the ten adaptation finance criteria are not met, which demonstrates that the diplomatic UNFCCC conceptualisation of financing adaptation is dissonant from the private sector reality. For example, while the case studies' investments are 'new and additional' to Official Development Assistance (ODA), their 'predictability' remains unclear. And despite some commitment for 'up-scaling', plans and associated costs for doing so remain undisclosed. Developed countries' role in 'mobilising' private financial resources under the PSI seems limited. It is unrealistic to expect that the UNFCCC alters existing criteria to suit private initiatives, or that the private sector aligns its initiatives to meet existing criteria. This paper advocates monitoring and reporting only of those private investments that principally finance adaptation. This practical way forward would allow private finance to meet criteria such as predictability, transparency, and mobilisation, but would drastically reduce the amount of private investment that could contribute to reaching the USD 100 billion climate finance target.",256,private sector role finance increasingly subject political scientific debate yet poor empirical evidence private potential contribution industrialised country mobilisation usd billion annual finance onwards support developing country address analysed study private sector private sector initiative psi unfccc nairobi work programme examined ten finance criterion distilled un negotiation outcome result private intervention complement activity yet ten finance criterion met demonstrates diplomatic unfccc conceptualisation financing dissonant private sector reality example study investment additional official development assistance oda predictability remains unclear despite commitment scaling plan associated cost remain undisclosed developed country role mobilising private financial resource psi seems unrealistic expect unfccc alters existing criterion suit private initiative private sector aligns initiative meet existing criterion advocate monitoring reporting private investment principally finance practical way forward would allow private finance meet criterion predictability transparency mobilisation would drastically reduce amount private investment could contribute reaching usd billion finance target
138,"Here and now, there and then: How ""departure dates"" influence climate change engagement",2016-01-01,"Climate change alters landscapes, challenges economic systems, and threatens human and environmental health. Yet, despite real and present impacts, climate change remains largely an abstract risk to most people in the U.S. Using a survey with an embedded experiment, we explore responses to messages about climate ""departure dates"" by manipulating the spatial and temporal dimensions of future climate change impacts in two exemplar cities (New York City and Singapore) among U.S: and Singapore participants. Overall, results suggest that the influence of temporal and spatial features of departure dates is moderated by participants' political orientation and geographic location.

139,European Climate Change Perceptions: Public support for mitigation and adaptation policies,2016-01-01,"This paper presents results from a large multi-country study focusing on public perceptions of climate change and relevant mitigation and adaptation policies in Spain, Netherlands, UK and Germany. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to understand the nature of public perceptions of global climate change in different countries; and secondly, to gauge the public's support of climate change measures in terms of mitigation and adaptation policies. Our analysis shows high levels of public indecisiveness regarding the danger climate change poses, which source of climate change information to trust and whether to support any mitigation or adaptation strategies. The high levels of uncertainty present an opportunity to increase policy support and foster behavioural changes in the future through well-designed communication programmes. Therefore, this study has identified several aspects that need to be considered in future communication programmes.

140,Transformation toward an eco-city: lessons from three Asian cities,2016-01-01,"This comparative case study of three Asian cities (Penghu in Taiwan, Seoul in South Korea and Tianjin in China) elucidates the effects of different national approaches to eco-city development and the antecedents of the building of an eco-city. To better understand the Asian context, the three Asian cities of interest were compared with two European cities - Freiburg (Germany) and Samso (Denmark). The effects of the approach to the development of an eco-city and the fitting of its business activities to the local context are investigated. The analysis identifies four transforming antecedents of the development of an eco-city in Asia, which are (1) utilization of a national approach and policy, (2) the presence of a dedicated local public authority, (3) the continuous engagement of local citizens, and (4) an infusion of national capability and business activity. The transformational development of an eco-city in Asia seeks to create a new techno-social regime that is based on sustainable solutions, whereas their respective national capabilities must be emphasized with an eye to efficiency, economy, and effectiveness simultaneously.

141,Farmers' perceptions of climate change: identifying types,2016-01-01,"Ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture have been set by both national governments and their respective livestock sectors. We hypothesize that farmer self-identity influences their assessment of climate change and their willingness to implement measures which address the issue. Perceptions of climate change were determined from 286 beef/sheep farmers and evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis elicits two components which evaluate identity (productivism and environmental responsibility), and two components which evaluate behavioral capacity to adopt mitigation and adaptation measures (awareness and risk perception). Subsequent Cluster Analyses reveal four farmer types based on the PCA scores. 'The Productivist' and 'The Countryside Steward' portray low levels of awareness of climate change, but differ in their motivation to adopt pro-environmental behavior. Conversely, both 'The Environmentalist' and 'The Dejected' score higher in their awareness of the issue. In addition, 'The Dejected' holds a high sense of perceived risk; however, their awareness is not conflated with an explicit understanding of agricultural GHG sources. With the exception of 'The Environmentalist', there is an evident disconnect between perceptions of agricultural emission sources and their contribution towards GHG emissions amongst all types. If such linkages are not conceptualized, it is unlikely that behavioral capacities will be realized. Effective communication channels which encourage action should target farmers based on the groupings depicted. Therefore, understanding farmer types through the constructs used in this study can facilitate effective and tailored policy development and implementation.",239,ambitious target reduce greenhouse gas ghg emission agriculture set national government respective livestock sector hypothesize farmer self identity influence assessment willingness implement measure address issue perception determined beef sheep farmer evaluated principal component analysis pca analysis elicits component evaluate identity productivism environmental responsibility component evaluate behavioral capacity adopt mitigation measure awareness risk perception subsequent cluster analysis reveal four farmer type based pca score productivist countryside steward portray low level awareness differ motivation adopt pro environmental behavior conversely environmentalist dejected score higher awareness issue addition dejected hold high sense perceived risk however awareness conflated explicit understanding agricultural ghg source exception environmentalist evident disconnect perception agricultural emission source contribution towards ghg emission amongst type linkage conceptualized unlikely behavioral capacity realized effective communication channel encourage action target farmer based grouping depicted therefore understanding farmer type construct used facilitate effective tailored policy development implementation
142,"""Proximising"" climate change reconsidered: A construal level theory perspective",2016-01-01,"Reducing the psychological distance of climate change has repeatedly been proposed as one strategy to increase individuals' motivation to respond to climate change. From the perspective of construal level theory, decreasing psychological distance should not itself influence people's willingness to act but change the processes that underlie individual decision-making. We conducted two experiments in which we manipulated the psychological distance of climate change. We found that participants with a distant focus relied more on scepticism to represent risks and make decisions about supporting climate change, whereas participants with a proximal perspective relied more on fear when making such judgements. However, the predicted Fear x Distance interaction was only found when self-reported fear rather than experimentally manipulated fear was used as a moderator. Our results suggest that simply proximising won't increase engagement and call for a more differentiated perspective on the effects of psychological distance in the context of climate change.

143,Effects of Visualizations and Information Rich Public Engagement in Planning for Energy and Emissions,2016-01-01,"Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are significant goals for many cities. Many promote ""smart growth"" development patterns aimed in part at reducing energy use and emissions. However, while citizens may endorse broad energy-mitigation policies, they often resist the implementation of such policies via smart growth and other mitigation initiatives in their own neighborhoods. This study looked at whether public understanding and acceptance of smart-growth policies could be improved if citizens were provided with timely, accessible visualizations about why and how such policies can help reduce energy use. This paper reviews two public-engagement workshops that utilized a collaborative touch table combined with three-dimensional visualizations and metrics that were updated in real time. Working both individually and collaboratively on an urban-design task, all participants improved the smart growth and energy-related performance of the study areas via their solutions in the first workshop, but they did not all further improve the energy-related performance of the areas after receiving additional energy knowledge and metrics in a follow-up workshop.

Before designing actions to support the communities struggling with these floods, we used an exploratory qualitative survey to collect the data needed to analyze the factors that facilitate or impede their mobilization and their capacity to act autonomously. The relevance of social capital was assessed and confirmed by studying existing intra-and inter-community relations and networks and their influence on the capacity to act and reclaim public space. Categories such as mutual support and informal social control, considered as non-exhaustive dimensions of social capital, together with aspects of governance (trust, civic engagement) and the composition of organized groups were used and correlated to various actions.

145,Conceptualising climate change in forest-based rural areas of South Africa: community perceptions and attitudes,2016-01-01,"The perceptions of forest-based communities in Vhembe District, South Africa, were examined. Special attention in this study was paid to the aspects linked to climate change, namely socio-cultural issues, views and awareness, beliefs about causes, concerns, and lifestyle adjustments that people are prepared to make. Vegetation type was considered as the major criterion when selecting Makhado, Mutale and Thulamela municipalities, which together with Musina, constitute Vhembe District in Limpopo Province. Seven rural communities in each municipality were selected. Using stratified proportionate random sampling in combination with weighted enumeration area (EA) for these communities, 366 households were chosen and interviewed. It was found that although awareness of 'climate change' was poor, most respondents understood what it meant and its associated challenges. Increasing occurrence of erratic rainfall and forest fires were regarded as visible manifestations of climate change. There was also strong concern about the effects of climate change on forests and forest-related products. The respondents expressed a desire to adopt responsible behaviour towards the use and management of forests as a climate-change intervention strategy. However, most community members were sceptical about the causes of climate change. Taking all these issues into account, it was clear that activities that would enlighten the people on the causes and consequences of climate change regarding their livelihoods should be carried out. This would help promote awareness of climate change and encourage people's participation in crafting measures that might help mitigate and adapt to climate change.",240,perception forest based community vhembe district south africa examined special attention paid aspect linked namely socio cultural issue view awareness belief cause concern lifestyle adjustment people prepared make vegetation type considered major criterion selecting makhado mutale thulamela municipality together musina constitute vhembe district limpopo province seven rural community municipality selected stratified proportionate random sampling combination weighted enumeration area ea community household chosen interviewed found although awareness poor respondent understood meant associated challenge increasing occurrence erratic rainfall forest fire regarded visible manifestation strong concern effect forest forest related product respondent expressed desire adopt responsible behaviour towards use management forest intervention strategy however community member sceptical cause taking issue account clear activity would enlighten people cause consequence regarding livelihood carried would help promote awareness encourage people participation crafting measure might help mitigate adapt

148,Exploring social representations of adapting to climate change using topic modeling and Bayesian networks,2016-01-01,"When something unfamiliar emerges or when something familiar does something unexpected people need to make sense of what is emerging or going on in order to act. Social representations theory suggests how individuals and society make sense of the unfamiliar and hence how the resultant social representations (SRs) cognitively, emotionally, and actively orient people and enable communication. SRs are social constructions that emerge through individual and collective engagement with media and with everyday conversations among people. Recent developments in text analysis techniques, and in particular topic modeling, provide a potentially powerful analytical method to examine the structure and content of SRs using large samples of narrative or text. In this paper I describe the methods and results of applying topic modeling to 660 micronarratives collected from Australian academics/researchers, government employees, and members of the public in 2010-2011. The narrative fragments focused on adaptation to climate change (CC) and hence provide an example of Australian society making sense of an emerging and conflict ridden phenomena. The results of the topic modeling reflect elements of SRs of adaptation to CC that are consistent with findings in the literature as well as being reasonably robust predictors of classes of action in response to CC. Bayesian Network (BN) modeling was used to identify relationships among the topics (SR elements) and in particular to identify relationships among topics, sentiment, and action. Finally the resulting model and topic modeling results are used to highlight differences in the salience of SR elements among social groups.

149,A stakeholder approach to building community resilience: awareness to implementation,2016-01-01,"Purpose - The paper aims to examine one local government's efforts to increase local-level engagement in building community disaster resilience. Presenting the empirical evidence of stakeholder engagement activities that increase risk awareness and encourage collective action, the study addresses a key priority for the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Hyogo Framework for Action 2) to identify methods for increasing local-level implementation of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative, case study approach is used to explore the case in depth. A review of literature from the multidisciplinary areas of communication, social and political theory frames data collection and analysis. Data collection includes observation, document analysis and interviews with policymakers, practitioners and local stakeholders to document achievements and lessons learnt from all perspectives. Findings - Preliminary results indicate that strong political leadership and inter-departmental coordination have contributed to engaging local-level participation in disaster risk reduction in the Municipality of Amadora, Portugal. Findings indicate that the implementation of a wide spectrum of public engagement initiatives has increased awareness of hazard risks amongst specific demographic groups and improved community and government capacity to identify and implement risk reduction strategies. Research limitations/implications - As this study is a work-in-progress and data analysis is in the early stages, interview transcripts included in this paper are limited to members of the team and their Director, Amadora Town Councillor for Civil Protection Services. Practical implications - It is commonly acknowledged that to date, achievements of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 largely remain at the national level and have not reached local levels in a substantial manner. Addressing the need for more industry-led research to explore examples of successful stakeholder participation, the paper's findings can be used by emergency management practitioners who recognise the need to merge climate change adaptation, risk reduction and local-level engagement to encourage public participation, inclusiveness and proactive planning.

Rural community responses to environmental challenges have been influenced by recent political decentralization governments and programs. This study explores how community governance processes under decentralization influenced the mobilization of community capitals used for adaptation to environmental stresses in four communities of southwestern Uruguay. Research methods include semi-structured interviews conducted in 2012-2013 with key informants from market, state, and civil society and participant observation and minutes from local public meetings and assemblies in four communities of this region. Consultation facilitated adaptive actions by the national government to make national governmental programs and institutions more responsive to local needs. Community empowerment for adaptive actions at the local level was minimal, due to the limited resources that have been devolved, reinforcing historic and current dependency on regional and national governmental institutions for those resources.

Through assessing Surat's experience with recent industrialization, episodes of natural disasters, to more recent engagement with the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, I highlight how adaptation planning, as well as how adaptation is integrated into urban development planning, occurs through processes of prioritizing adaptation against development needs and implementing options that are cocreated among public and civic actors. This case empirically shows how adaptation is mainstreamed into urban development planning, illustrates the trade-offs associated with how different urban actors plan and implement adaptation in the context of rapid industrialization, and assesses how internationally funded adaptation programs are operationalized in the context of local social and political realities.",166,argues political economic approach understanding development planning urban context based field research conducted surat india across period year illustrate rooted preexisting contextually specific urban political relationship traced city developmental history assessing surat experience recent industrialization episode natural disaster recent asian city resilience network highlight planning well integrated urban development planning occurs process prioritizing development need implementing option cocreated among civic actor empirically show mainstreamed urban development planning illustrates trade offs associated different urban actor plan implement context rapid industrialization ass internationally funded program operationalized context local social political reality

Results showed that the high-compassion condition elicited greater self-reported compassion and stronger belief that a climate-related humanitarian crisis was caused by human activities, both of which, in turn, mediated increased policy support particularly among political conservatives and moderates (compared to liberals).

153,"Spatiotemporal analysis of encroachment on wetlands: a case of Nakivubo wetland in Kampala, Uganda",2016-01-01,"Wetlands provide vital ecosystem services such as water purification, flood control, and climate moderation among others, which enhance environmental quality, promote public health, and contribute to risk reduction. The biggest threat to wetlands is posed by human activities which transform wetlands, often for short-term consumptive benefits. This paper aimed to classify and map recent land cover and provide a multi-temporal analysis of changes from 2002 to 2014 in the Nakivubo wetland through which wastewater from Kampala city drains to Lake Victoria in Uganda. The paper contributes through spatially congruent change maps showing site-specific land cover conversions. In addition, it gives insight into what happened to the wetlands, why it happened, how the changes in the wetlands affect the communities living in them, and how the situation could be better managed or regulated in future. The analysis is based on very high resolution (50-62 cm) aerial photos and satellite imagery, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Overall, the analysis of losses and gains showed a 62 % loss of wetland vegetation between 2002 and 2014, mostly attributable to crop cultivation. Cultivation in the wetland buffering the lake shore makes it unstable to anchor. The 2014 data shows large portions of the wetland calved away by receding lake waves. With barely no wetland vegetation buffer around the lake, the heavily polluted wastewater streams will lower the quality of lake water. Furthermore, with increased human activities in the wetland, exposure to flooding and pollution will be likely to have a greater impact on the health and livelihoods of vulnerable communities. This calls for a multi-faceted approach, coordination of the various stakeholders and engagement of wetland-dependent communities as part of the solution, and might require zoning out the wetland and restricting certain activities to specific zones.",293,wetland provide vital ecosystem service water purification flood control moderation among others enhance environmental quality promote health contribute risk reduction biggest threat wetland posed human activity transform wetland often short term consumptive benefit aimed classify map recent land cover provide multi temporal analysis change nakivubo wetland wastewater kampala city drain lake victoria uganda contributes spatially congruent map showing site specific land cover conversion addition give insight happened wetland happened change wetland affect community living situation could better managed regulated future analysis based high resolution cm aerial photo satellite imagery focus group discussion key informant interview overall analysis loss gain showed loss wetland vegetation mostly attributable crop cultivation cultivation wetland buffering lake shore make unstable anchor data show portion wetland calved away receding lake wave barely wetland vegetation buffer around lake heavily polluted wastewater stream lower quality lake water furthermore increased human activity wetland exposure flooding pollution likely greater impact health livelihood vulnerable community call multi faceted approach coordination various stakeholder wetland dependent community part solution might require zoning wetland restricting certain activity specific zone
154,Reflections on climate change communication research and practice in the second decade of the 21st century: what more is there to say?,2016-01-01,"Appreciable advances have been made in recent years in raising climate change awareness and enhancing support for climate and energy policies. There also has been considerable progress in understanding of how to effectively communicate climate change. This progress raises questions about the future directions of communication research and practice. What more is there to say? Through a selective literature review, focused on contributions since a similar stock-taking exercise in 2010,(1) the article delineates significant advances, emerging trends and topics, and tries to chart critical needs and opportunities going forward. It describes the climate communication landscape midway through the second decade of the 21st century to contextualize the challenges faced by climate change communication as a scientific field. Despite the important progress made on key scientific challenges laid out in 2010, persistent challenges remain (superficial public understanding of climate change, transitioning from awareness and concern to action, communicating in deeply politicized and polarized environments, and dealing with the growing sense of overwhelm and hopelessness). In addition, new challenges and topics have emerged that communication researchers and practitioners now face. The study reflects on the crucial need to improve the interaction between climate communication research and practice, and calls for dedicated science-practice boundary work focused on climate change communication. A set of new charges to climate communicators and researchers are offered in hopes to move climate change communication to a new placeat once more humble yet also more ambitious than ever before, befitting to the crucial role it could play in the cultural work humanity faces with climate change.

Drawing upon literature of emotional geography, social dimensions of climate change, and public participation, this study illustrates the role of emotion in a public participation exercise in Londonderry, Vermont - a small town struggling to recover from Tropical Storm Irene. As a member of an interdisciplinary design team that facilitated a workshop on flood resilience and adaptive design in Londonderry, I witnessed an innovative exercise that employed storytelling, emotion, and body movement. This activity, which I term 'emotive-physical storytelling', created a foundation of trust and interpersonal connection that facilitators and residents built upon to plan for flood resiliency. Contrary to recent accounts of the ways that negative emotional responses can cause inaction in the face of climate change, this paper argues that creative public participation methods can generate positive emotions such as hope, responsibility, care, and solidarity. Such emotions have the potential to inspire adaptive action and produce transformative change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

156,Empirical evidence for different cognitive effects in explaining the attribution of marine range shifts to climate change,2016-01-01,"The changing geographical distribution of species, or range shift, is one of the better documented fingerprints of climate change in the marine environment. Range shifts may also lead to dramatic changes in the distribution of economic, social, and cultural opportunities. These challenge marine resource users' capacity to adapt to a changing climate and managers' ability to implement adaptation plans. In particular, a reluctance to attribute marine range shift to climate change can undermine the effectiveness of climate change communications and pose a potential barrier to successful adaptation. Attribution is a known powerful predictor of behavioural intention. Understanding the cognitive processes that underpin the formation of marine resource users' beliefs about the cause of observed marine range shift phenomena is therefore an important topic for research. An examination of the attribution by marine resource users of three types of range shifts experienced in a marine climate change hotspot in southeast Australia to various climate and non-climate drivers indicates the existence of at least three contributing cognitions. These are: (i) engrained mental representations of environmental phenomena, (ii) scientific complexity in the attribution pathway, and (iii) dissonance from the positive or negative nature of the impact. All three play a part in explaining the complex pattern of attribution of marine climate change range shifts, and should be considered when planning for engagement with stakeholders and managers around adaptation to climate change.",228,changing geographical distribution specie range shift better documented fingerprint marine environment range shift may lead dramatic change distribution economic social cultural opportunity challenge marine resource user capacity adapt changing manager ability implement plan particular reluctance attribute marine range shift undermine effectiveness communication pose potential barrier successful attribution known powerful predictor behavioural intention understanding cognitive process underpin formation marine resource user belief cause observed marine range shift phenomenon therefore important topic research examination attribution marine resource user three type range shift experienced marine hotspot southeast australia various non driver indicates existence least three contributing cognition engrained mental representation environmental phenomenon ii scientific complexity attribution pathway iii dissonance positive negative nature impact three play part explaining complex pattern attribution marine range shift considered planning stakeholder manager around
157,"Climate adaptation at what scale? Multi-level governance, resilience, and coproduction in Saint Louis, Senegal",2016-01-01,"This paper utilizes a multi-level governance framework to explain how and at what scale climate adaptation, exemplified by flood risk management, was governed in the medium-scale city of Saint Louis, Senegal. It explores how this policy sector worked toward a ""resilient city'' pointing to gaps between governance as prescribed and as practiced. The paper suggests that strong coordination of climate change adaptation and flood risk management should take place at city level, reflecting the ""place-based'' character of these policy sectors. However, adaptation cannot be addressed successfully at any single geographic scale or by any one category of actor. Effective collaboration across politico-administrative boundaries at multiple scales is required in order to address tensions between competing policy agendas and tackle socio-spatial inequality and vulnerability. We found that public officials at the city and regional state level encouraged some degree of citizen participation in planning and input into adaptation. However, despite emerging networks for city-level coordination and capacity to adapt to flood risks among local residents, there were limitations in how higher-level government and institutions supported the lower levels in vertical and horizontal coordination. In particular, services and investments within poor and vulnerable settlements were lacking.

158,Role-play simulations for climate change adaptation education and engagement,2016-01-01,"In order to effectively adapt to climate change, public officials and other stakeholders need to rapidly enhance their understanding of local risks and their ability to collaboratively and adaptively respond to them. We argue that science-based role-play simulation exercises - a type of 'serious game' involving face-to-face mock decision-making - have considerable potential as education and engagement tools for enhancing readiness to adapt. Prior research suggests role-play simulations and other serious games can foster public learning and encourage collective action in public policy-making contexts. However, the effectiveness of such exercises in the context of climate change adaptation education and engagement has heretofore been underexplored. We share results from two research projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of role-play simulations in cultivating climate change adaptation literacy, enhancing collaborative capacity and facilitating social learning. Based on our findings, we suggest such exercises should be more widely embraced as part of adaptation professionals' education and engagement toolkits.",153,order effectively adapt official stakeholder need rapidly enhance understanding local risk ability collaboratively adaptively respond argue science based role play simulation exercise type serious game involving face face mock decision making considerable potential education tool enhancing readiness adapt prior research suggests role play simulation serious game foster learning encourage collective action policy making context however effectiveness exercise context education heretofore underexplored share result research project demonstrate effectiveness role play simulation cultivating literacy enhancing collaborative capacity facilitating social learning based finding suggest exercise widely embraced part professional education toolkits

Similar to climate change communication, SLR risk communication presents challenges involving complex science, uncertainty, invisibility, and politicization. To be comprehensible and persuasive, risk messages must be appropriately framed and visually compelling and must take into account risk perceptions and diverse viewpoints. Our approach involves assessing people's encounters with actual risk messages to determine their reactions and responses. Participants in this study had difficulty understanding information and expressed attitudes including fear, fatalism, skepticism, and loss. SLR risks were also perceived as both temporally and spatially distant, creating a challenge for communicators trying to convey a sense of urgency.

160,Felt responsibility and climate engagement: Distinguishing adaptation from mitigation,2016-01-01,"Policy makers and citizens must choose from among a growing variety of strategic options as they try to cope optimally with climate change. As a means of more accurately predicting different types of climate change engagement, we empirically distinguish individuals' felt responsibility for mitigation (FRm) from felt responsibility for adaptation (FRa), and assess support for different climate action strategies (mitigation and adaptation). We surveyed two U.S. samples two months apart, and the replication study confirmed Study l's findings of differing predictive powers for FRm vs. FRa. Each type of felt responsibility, controlling for the other, served as a mediator between belief in global warming (as well as belief in anthropogenic cause of climate change) and its corresponding climate action strategy (mitigation vs. adaptation). FRa predicted adaptation measures but not mitigation measures, while FRm predicted mitigation measures more strongly than it predicted adaptation but did predict both action strategies. We also found important individual differences: people's disposition toward behaving proactively correlated positively with all types of climate engagement, and political orientation (liberal/ conservative ideology) interacted with climate action strategy (mitigation vs. adaptation) in predicting all engagement variables. Comparing levels of support across the political spectrum, the mitigation measures were highly polarizing, while the adaptation measures were less divisive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

161,Comparing Approaches for the Integration of Stakeholder Perspectives in Environmental Decision Making,2016-01-01,"Including stakeholder perspectives in environmental decision making is in many countries a legal requirement and is widely seen as beneficial as it can help increase decision legitimacy, likelihood of implementation, and quality of the outcome. Whereas the theoretical literature on stakeholder engagement is large, less attention has been devoted to comparing and discussing different methodological approaches. Here, we compare three approaches-multi-criteria analysis, plural rationality theory, and scenario construction-that include stakeholders' perspectives in environmental decision making. We find differences between the approaches concerning the assumptions about stakeholder rationality and whether experts and/or stakeholders are in charge of framing the problem. Further differences concern the type of data input from stakeholders and how it is used by the experts, as well as the role of stakeholders and whether they are involved early-already for identifying options-or later in the process, for evaluating or ranking alternatives analyzed by the experts. The choice of approach thus predetermines the type and depth of stakeholder engagement. No approach is ""better"" than another, but they are suited for different problems and research aims: the choice of the approach, however, has a large impact on the results.",188,including stakeholder perspective environmental decision making many country legal requirement widely seen beneficial help increase decision legitimacy likelihood implementation quality outcome whereas theoretical literature stakeholder le attention devoted comparing discussing different methodological approach compare three approach multi criterion analysis plural rationality theory scenario construction include stakeholder perspective environmental decision making find difference approach concerning assumption stakeholder rationality whether expert stakeholder charge framing problem difference concern type data input stakeholder used expert well role stakeholder whether involved early already identifying option later process evaluating ranking alternative analyzed expert choice approach thus predetermines type depth stakeholder approach better another suited different problem research aim choice approach however impact result
162,Evaluation of the role of risk perception in stakeholder engagement to prevent lead exposure in an urban setting,2016-01-01,"Stakeholder engagement is a vital sustainable remediation practice for obtaining useful feedback and identifying societal needs. Evaluating and integrating risk perception of stakeholders into remediation and outreach efforts allows for greater insight, increases the likelihood of success and ultimately, benefits the community by protecting its members from environmental hazards. In this study, we identified risk perception factors that influenced residents' level of concern for mitigating their exposure to elevated concentrations of lead in household paint and historic fill material. Risk perception factors were assessed by an in-person survey conducted in public green spaces. The analysis of survey participants' responses indicated that their perception of risk to exposed lead was mostly influenced by the presence of hazardous materials in close proximity to their residence, the ability to address pollution, and awareness, interest, and individual accountability in mitigating environmental risks. Responses also revealed that residents considered risk of lead and soil pollution as less menacing than the presence of more immediate and perceptible risks posed by factors such as air and water pollution. In addition, the community seemed to exhibit ""optimism bias"" and did not identify itself at high risk to susceptible and immediate hazards, including lead exposure. This lack of concern over lead exposure created a significant obstacle to community participation in state-led education and outreach programs. By integrating risk perception analysis and increasing stakeholder engagement, we can bring more attention to this issue, educate the public about the threat of lead pollution, and efficiently use financial resources to implement a more sustainable solution.

163,Between adaptability and the urge to control: making long-term water policies in the Netherlands,2017-01-01,"Triggered by recent flood catastrophes and increasing concerns about climate change, scientists as well as policy-makers increasingly call for making long-term water policies to enable a transformation towards flood resilience. A key question is how to make these long-term policies adaptive so that they are able to deal with uncertainties and changing circumstances. The paper proposes three conditions for making long-term water policies adaptive, which are then used to evaluate a new Dutch water policy approach called Adaptive Delta Management'. Analysing this national policy approach and its translation to the Rotterdam region reveals that Dutch policy-makers are torn between adaptability and the urge to control. Reflecting on this dilemma, the paper suggests a stronger focus on monitoring and learning to strengthen the adaptability of long-term water policies. Moreover, increasing the adaptive capacity of society also requires a stronger engagement with local stakeholders including citizens and businesses.",146,triggered recent flood catastrophe increasing concern scientist well policy maker increasingly call making long term water policy enable transformation towards flood resilience key question make long term policy adaptive able deal uncertainty changing circumstance proposes three condition making long term water policy adaptive used evaluate dutch water policy approach called adaptive delta management analysing national policy approach translation rotterdam region reveals dutch policy maker torn adaptability urge control reflecting dilemma suggests stronger focus monitoring learning strengthen adaptability long term water policy moreover increasing adaptive capacity society requires stronger local stakeholder including citizen business

166,"Brazilian Media and Climate Change: Analysis of Media Coverage Trends, Approaches and Criteria of Newsworthiness",2017-01-01,"The media have an important role in invigorating the public sphere and creating a forum for public discourse. This is especially critical for climate change and the public understanding of this phenomenon, including its uncertainties, controversies, risks and threats as well as future projections and coping possibilities. The media offer to the individuals symbolic forms of representing their relations with the phenomenon, and have the responsibility to represent complex issues related to climate change, seeking to connect them to the experiences of modern life. Understanding how the media have covered and diffused these issues is a big challenge for researchers who work on the triad science - communication - society. This paper seeks to contribute to this analytical field and filling the gap in terms of Brazilian studies focused on climate change and coverage, presenting and discussing results of a study conducted between 2014 and 2016, which aimed: (i) to understand the coverage media of issues related to climate change and energy throughout an analyses of news published between 2000 and 2014 in a large national Brazilian newspaper; (ii) to understand journalists' perceptions of media coverage on climate change through content analysis of interviews with Brazilian professionals who cover these issues. Results are presented and discussed considering three arguments: (i) tendency for an event-centred coverage reporting; (ii) change in the coverage trends of climate change along the years; (iii) adoption of criteria of newsworthiness to select information and cover climate change, including sense of opportunity, interest for human and conflict.",250,medium important role invigorating sphere creating forum discourse especially critical understanding phenomenon including uncertainty controversy risk threat well future projection coping possibility medium offer individual symbolic form representing relation phenomenon responsibility represent complex issue related seeking connect experience modern life understanding medium covered diffused issue big challenge researcher work triad science communication society seek contribute analytical field filling gap term brazilian study focused coverage presenting discussing result conducted aimed understand coverage medium issue related energy throughout analysis news published national brazilian newspaper ii understand journalist perception medium coverage content analysis interview brazilian professional cover issue result presented discussed considering three argument tendency event centred coverage reporting ii coverage trend along year iii adoption criterion newsworthiness select information cover including sense opportunity interest human conflict
167,Climate change typologies and audience segmentation among Corn Belt farmers,2017-01-01,"Development of natural resource user typologies has been viewed as a potentially effective means of improving the effectiveness of natural resource management engagement strategies. Prior research on Corn Belt farmers' perspectives on climate change employed a latent class analysis (LCA) that created a six-class typology-the Concerned, Uneasy, Uncertain, Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached-to develop a better understanding of farmer perspectives on climate change and inform more effective climate adaptation and mitigation outreach strategies. The LCA employed 34 variables that are generally unobservable- beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks of climate change, and attitudes toward climate action-to identify types. The research reported in this paper builds on this typology of Corn Belt farmers by exploring 33 measures of observable farm enterprise characteristics, land management practices, and farmer demographics to assess whether variations in these observable characteristics between the six farmer classes display systematic patterns that might be sufficiently distinctive to guide audience segmentation strategies. While analyses detected some statistically significant differences, there were few systematic, meaningful observable patterns of difference between groups of farmers with differing perspectives on climate change. In other words, farmers who believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that adaptive action should be taken, may look very much like farmers who deny the existence of climate change and do not support action. The overall implication of this finding is that climate change engagement efforts by Extension and other agricultural advisors should use caution when looking to observable characteristics to facilitate audience segmentation. Additional analyses indicated that the farmer types that tended to be more concerned about climate change and supportive of adaptive action (e.g., Concerned and Uneasy) reported that they were more influenced by key private and public sector actors in agricultural social networks. On the other hand, farmers who were not concerned about climate change or supportive of adaptation (e. g., the Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached groups, comprising between one-third and one-half of respondents) were less integrated into agricultural networks. This suggests that Extension and other agricultural advisors should expand outreach efforts to farmers who are not already within their spheres of influence.",357,development natural resource user typology viewed potentially effective mean improving effectiveness natural resource management strategy prior research corn belt farmer perspective employed latent class analysis lca created six class typology concerned uneasy uncertain unconcerned confident detached develop better understanding farmer perspective inform effective mitigation outreach strategy lca employed variable generally unobservable belief experience extreme weather perceived risk attitude toward action identify type research reported build typology corn belt farmer exploring measure observable farm enterprise characteristic land management practice farmer demographic ass whether variation observable characteristic six farmer class display systematic pattern might sufficiently distinctive guide audience segmentation strategy analysis detected statistically significant difference systematic meaningful observable pattern difference group farmer differing perspective word farmer believe anthropogenic occurring pose risk agriculture adaptive action taken may look much like farmer deny existence support action overall implication finding effort extension agricultural advisor use caution looking observable characteristic facilitate audience segmentation additional analysis indicated farmer type tended concerned supportive adaptive action e g concerned uneasy reported influenced key private sector actor agricultural social network hand farmer concerned supportive e g unconcerned confident detached group comprising third half respondent le integrated agricultural network suggests extension agricultural advisor expand outreach effort farmer already within sphere influence
168,Bridging the climate information gap: a framework for engaging knowledge brokers and decision makers in state climate assessments,2016-01-01,"Large-scale analyses like the National Climate Assessment (NCA) contain a wealth of information critical to national and regional responses to climate change but tend to be insufficiently detailed for action at state or local levels. Many states now engage in assessment processes to meet information needs for local authorities. The goals of state climate assessments (SCAs) should be to provide relevant, actionable information to state and local authorities, and to generate primary sources, build networks and inform stakeholders. To communicate local climate impacts to decision makers, SCAs should express credibility, salience and legitimacy. They can provide information (e.g., case studies, data sets) and connect stakeholders to the NCA and its process. Based on our experience in the Vermont Climate Assessment (VCA), we present a framework to engage decision makers in SCAs using a fluid network of scientific experts and knowledge brokers to conduct subject area prioritization, data analysis and writing. The VCA addressed economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change at local scales to increase resiliency and manage risk.

Cultural worldviews which contribute to politically polarized beliefs about climate were predictive of perceptions of sea level rise risk. Living close to flooding hazards. also significantly predicted respondents' perceptions of household or neighborhood risks, but not of risks to the entire county. The event significantly increased topic knowledge among all participants and, among those with a worldview predisposing them to lower risk perceptions, significantly increased problem identification and concern about impacts.

171,Understanding climate adaptation investments for communities living in desert Australia: experiences of indigenous communities,2016-01-01,"Climate change is predicted to lead to warmer temperatures and more intense storms within the century in central and northern Australia. The ensuing impacts are anticipated to present immense challenges for remote communities, in terms of maintaining housing comfort, family health and wellbeing, engagement in education and employment, and community services and businesses. About 50 % of the Australian landmass is considered remote and it is home to a highly dispersed population of about half a million people (with 30 % being Indigenous people). Much of the population in remote Australia is considered highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change as they are highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts, with many having a low adaptive capacity. The lives of Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities are strongly influenced and governed by traditional customs, knowledge and practices. Even when living in large towns, people who are strongly connected to their country are able to blend knowledge from traditional and modern sources to adapt to the current climate. This article explores the extent of adaptive capacity of people to climate change in a small remote community and large service town in the Northern Territory of Australia and provides insights about their capacities and vulnerabilities.

172,Prescriptive conflict prevention analysis: An application to the 2021 update of the Austrian flood risk management plan,2016-01-01,"Flood events have become more frequent in Europe, and the adaptation to the increasing flood risks is needed. The Flood Directive set up a series of measures to increase European resilience, establishing Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) at the level of the river basin district as one relevant action. In order to efficiently fulfil this objective, the involvement of stakeholders as well as the analysis of their roles, responsibilities, and demands has been considered to be crucial to develop FRMPs. As a result, the hypothesis tested in this paper is that a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian Flood Risk Management Plan is feasible. To demonstrate this, both in-depth interviews and questionnaires to key Austrian stakeholders are implemented. The information collected in both participatory techniques are then used to run a conflict prevention analysis. The results show that (a) improving the coordination among regions and including better land-use planning approaches are preferable to a hypothetical business as usual scenario; and (b) a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian FRMP might be achievable on the basis of both a deep discussion on the state-of-the art and green infrastructure development.

A new analytical framework to examine and test how moral reasoning underpins and legitimizes governance and practice on adaptation to climate change risks is proposed. It develops a typology of eight categories of vulnerability-based and system-based moral reasoning that pertain to the dilemmas around adaptation and examines the prevalence of these moral categories in public discourse about specific adaptation issues. The framework is tested using data on climate change impact, adaptation, and societal responsibility, drawn from 14 focus groups comprising 148 participants across the UK.

Previous research indicates that experiencing extreme weather events has the potential to heighten engagement with climate change, however the process by which this occurs remains largely unknown, and establishing a clear causal relationship from experience to perceptions is methodologically challenging. The UK winter flooding offered a natural experiment to examine this question in detail. We compare individuals personally affected by flooding (n = 162) to a nationally representative sample (n = 975). We show that direct experience of flooding leads to an overall increased salience of climate change, pronounced emotional responses and greater perceived personal vulnerability and risk perceptions. We also present the first evidence that direct flooding experience can give rise to behavioural intentions beyond individual sustainability actions, including support for mitigation policies, and personal climate adaptation in matters unrelated to the direct experience.",160,winter saw series severe storm hit uk leading widespread flooding major emergency response extensive medium exposure previous research indicates experiencing extreme weather event potential heighten however process occurs remains largely unknown establishing clear causal relationship experience perception methodologically challenging uk winter flooding offered natural experiment examine question detail compare individual personally affected flooding n nationally representative sample n direct experience flooding lead overall increased salience pronounced emotional response greater perceived personal vulnerability risk perception present first evidence direct flooding experience give rise behavioural intention beyond individual sustainability action including support mitigation policy personal matter unrelated direct experience

It also conveys a decision focus in the form of decision support tools, stakeholder engagement and new knowledge about the science-policy interface. This paper demonstrates how policy decisions and human behaviour can be better integrated into climate and hydrological models to improve their usefulness for decision support. Examples from SW USA and western Canada highlight uncertainties, vulnerabilities and critical tradeoffs facing water decision makers in the face of rapidly changing environmental and societal conditions. Irreducible uncertainties in downscaled climate and hydrological models limit the usefulness of climate-driven, predict-and-plan methods of water resource planning and management. Thus, it is argued that such methods should be replaced by approaches that use exploratory modelling, scenario planning and risk assessment in which the emphasis is on managing uncertainty rather than on reducing it. Model fusion supports all of these processes in integrating human and biophysical aspects of water systems, allowing policy impacts to be quantified and clarified, and fostering public engagement with water resource modelling.",187,socio hydrology brings interest human value market social organization policy traditional emphasis water science hydrology toxicology ecology conveys decision focus form decision support tool stakeholder knowledge science policy interface demonstrates policy decision human behaviour better integrated hydrological model improve usefulness decision support example sw usa western canada highlight uncertainty vulnerability critical tradeoff facing water decision maker face rapidly changing environmental societal condition irreducible uncertainty downscaled hydrological model limit usefulness driven predict plan method water resource planning management thus argued method replaced approach use exploratory modelling scenario planning risk assessment emphasis managing uncertainty rather reducing model fusion support process integrating human biophysical aspect water system allowing policy impact quantified clarified fostering water resource modelling
177,The Potential of Living Labs for Smart Heritage Building Adaptation,2017-01-01,"This paper examines: smart buildings as part of 'smart cities'; the particular challenges of heritage buildings; whether smart heritage buildings have any specific characteristics; the lack of data to inform appropriate refurbishment and retrofit; the emerging potential of technologies to engage people in acquiring that data and build bridges towards smart heritage, so easing the task of sustaining heritage buildings for the benefit of current and future generations; and 'Living Labs' as a key enabler. It is increasingly argued that there is a need to involve citizens in city development, so urban areas may be rendered more suitable to their needs and social problems be prevented. Meanwhile it is held that the value and significance of Heritage buildings and landscapes needs to be maintained, despite increasing pressures to adapt all building stock to address climate change and reduce increasingly expensive energy use. To convincingly engage citizens, such adaptation needs to enhance rather than reduce quality of life for users. Over the last decade there has been a move to repeated post-occupancy evaluation (POE), including some heritage building stocks, to ensure these goals continue to be achieved. Yet it can be argued that the number of such POE studies is limited by shortages of expertise, to the extent that in most cases we still lack sufficient data about the existing building stock, and in particular Heritage buildings, to make reliably informed judgements on suitable adaptation and mitigation measures.

178,An Innovative Model for Engagement of Rural Citizens/Community of Bangladesh with Climate Change,2017-01-01,"Citizens/community engagement (CE) is a ""two-way interaction between the citizens and government(s) or the private sector that give citizens a stake in decision making, with the objective of improving development outcomes"". CE is about human development/human welfare with respect to education, food and health security, sustainability and climate change. This article proposes a new model encompassing some innovative programmes and projects with the aim of engaging rural community of Bangladesh (referred to here as CE) with climate change adaptation and mitigation, climate risks management (CRM) and climate resilient development (CRD) and lowcarbon development (LCD). The proposed CE programme includes: (a) education of rural citizens; (b)-training of rural farmers on sustainable and climate-smart agriculture, climate-smart aquaculture practices and disaster management; and (c) generation of new job opportunities via climate-smart agriculture, aquaculture/fisheries, clean/green energy and carbon sink projects. The proposed CE has relevance with the newly globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The CE programmes will be coordinated by the Upazila (Sub-district) Administration and relevant departments within the Upazila. It is envisaged that CE programmes and projects would reduce poverty, hunger and enhance economic, social and environmental growth and development in rural Bangladesh in a most sustainable way. To implement CE, five levels of engagement strategies would be adopted (inform, consult, involve, collaborate and empower citizens/community). The success of CE on targeted objectives/goals will be evaluated based on costs and time spent, benefits achieved, feedback received from participants via satisfactory survey results etc.",241,citizen community ce way interaction citizen government private sector give citizen stake decision making objective improving development outcome ce human development human welfare respect education food health security sustainability proposes model encompassing innovative programme project aim engaging rural community bangladesh referred ce mitigation risk management crm resilient development crd lowcarbon development lcd proposed ce programme includes education rural citizen b training rural farmer sustainable smart agriculture smart aquaculture practice disaster management c generation job opportunity via smart agriculture aquaculture fishery clean green energy carbon sink project proposed ce relevance newly globally agreed sustainable development goal sdgs ce programme coordinated upazila sub district administration relevant department within upazila envisaged ce programme project would reduce poverty hunger enhance economic social environmental growth development rural bangladesh sustainable way implement ce five level strategy would adopted inform consult involve collaborate empower citizen community success ce targeted objective goal evaluated based cost time spent benefit achieved feedback received participant via satisfactory survey result etc
179,Identifying and understanding attitudinal diversity on multi-functional changes in woodlands of the Ukrainian Carpathians,2017-01-01,"This paper advances existing knowledge of stakeholder attitudes towards ecosystem-based forest strategies and management practices in marginalized mountain areas of the Ukrainian Carpathians. The principal research question was to analyse the state of affairs regarding multi-functional changes in upland woodlands, as viewed by relevant stakeholders. An ultimate goal was to assist decision-makers in evaluation (e.g. through stakeholder evaluation using the suggested method) and implementation (through stakeholder engagement) of sustainable policy and management decisions. The Q-method, with the sequential application of its correlation and factor analytical tools, was applied to elucidate a range of existing attitudes (e.g. towards the expansion of woodlands under climate change and other drivers) and the spectrum of sustainability (its ecological, economic and social components) to which they relate. Dominant attitudes of representatives of relevant stakeholder groups towards multi-functional changes in forestry in the Carpathian Mountains were revealed and analysed. Key factors influencing the attitudinal diversity were explained. The results improve our understanding of stakeholder priorities and of commonalities and differences in existing attitudes/perceptions, providing some indication of how the diversity of attitudes towards forestry changes (e.g. integration of woodlands in mountain landscapes) could potentially influence sustainable forestry decisions. At times, entirely opposite attitudes (e.g. of the so-called Conservationists and Productivists attitudinal groups) towards forestry practices and key objectives of forestry in the Carpathian uplands were revealed. However, people put strong emphasis on multi-functional forestry offering a range of benefits to people, the environment and the economy.",240,advance existing knowledge stakeholder attitude towards ecosystem based forest strategy management practice marginalized mountain area ukrainian carpathians principal research question analyse state affair regarding multi functional change upland woodland viewed relevant stakeholder ultimate goal assist decision maker evaluation e g stakeholder evaluation suggested method implementation stakeholder sustainable policy management decision q method sequential application correlation factor analytical tool applied elucidate range existing attitude e g towards expansion woodland driver spectrum sustainability ecological economic social component relate dominant attitude representative relevant stakeholder group towards multi functional change forestry carpathian mountain revealed analysed key factor influencing attitudinal diversity explained result improve understanding stakeholder priority commonality difference existing attitude perception providing indication diversity attitude towards forestry change e g integration woodland mountain landscape could potentially influence sustainable forestry decision time entirely opposite attitude e g called conservationist productivists attitudinal group towards forestry practice key objective forestry carpathian upland revealed however people put strong emphasis multi functional forestry offering range benefit people environment economy
180,"Conditions for citizen co-production in a resilient, efficient and legitimate flood risk governance arrangement. A tentative framework",2017-01-01,"Across Europe, there is an increasing trend towards citizen involvement in the implementation of flood risk governance.

181,Urban Waterfront Revivals of the Future,2017-01-01,"Urban waterfronts form part of cities' critical intersection between the natural and man-made environment, linking the city and its inhabitants with water. In the context of high density urban environments, they are integral to the network of green and public spaces and have the potential to encompass a range of uses including residential, commercial, leisure, recreational, heritage and art offering a multitude of economic, social, environmental benefits. The cases of HafenCity Hamburg and Waterfront Toronto discussed in this paper demonstrate successful approaches to achieving social and environmental sustainability at the waterfronts, highlighting the importance of ensuring mixed uses, public access, sustainable design and construction of buildings and infrastructure including climate change adaptations. Integrated and incremental planning of waterfronts in conjunction with citywide planning alongside careful consideration for greening, urban ecology, biodiversity, and aquatic ecosystems is also critical.

182,Global Warming and Its Health Impact,2017-01-01,"Since the mid-19th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.",390,since mid th century human activity increased greenhouse gas carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide earth atmosphere resulted increased average temperature effect rising temperature include soil degradation loss productivity agricultural land desertification loss biodiversity degradation ecosystem reduced fresh water resource acidification ocean disruption depletion stratospheric ozone impact human health causing non communicable disease injury natural disaster malnutrition famine increased mortality heat wave due complication chronically ill patient direct exposure natural disaster impact mental health although complex quantified link even established civil violence time reduce agricultural resource reduced availability water alteration shrinking arable land increased pollution accumulation toxic substance food chain creation habitat suitable transmission human animal pathogen people living low income country particularly vulnerable scenario include distribution infectious disease warming change outbreak associated weather extreme event flood increased case leptospirosis campylobacter infection cryptosporidiosis reported global warming affect water heating rising transmission water borne pathogen pathogen transmitted vector particularly sensitive spend good part life cycle cold blooded host invertebrate whose temperature similar environment warmer present favorable condition survival completion life cycle vector going far speed mosquito disease transmitted mosquito include widespread worldwide illness malaria viral disease tick borne disease increased past year cold region rising temperature accelerate cycle development production egg density distribution tick population area presence tick disease transmit increased term geographical extension altitude next year health sector would working develop prevention program order reduce cost burden

How does evidence-based communication influence local residents' risk perception and potential behavior change in support of climate planning? Built upon our previous study of Climate Justice maps illustrating high scores of both social and ecological vulnerability in Michigan's Huron River watershed, USA, a quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effects of Climate Justice mapping intervention on residents' perceptions and preparedness for climate change associated hazards in Michigan. Two groups were compared: residents in Climate Justice areas with high social and ecological vulnerability scores in the watershed (n = 76) and residents in comparison areas in Michigan (n = 69). Measurements for risk perception include perceived exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability to hazards. Results indicate that risk information has a significant effect on perceived sensitivity and level of preparedness for future climate extremes among participants living in Climate Justice areas. Findings highlight the value of integrating scientific risk assessment information in risk communication to align calculated and perceived risks.

184,"Collaborative Approaches to Flow Restoration in Intermittent Salmon-Bearing Streams: Salmon Creek, CA, USA",2017-01-01,"In Mediterranean-climate regions of California and southern Oregon, juvenile salmon depend on groundwater aquifers to sustain their tributary habitats through the dry summers. Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work.",230,mediterranean region california southern oregon juvenile salmon depend groundwater aquifer sustain tributary habitat dry summer along california north coast stream private property regime land created common tragedy groundwater salmon fishery classic example common often governed collectively sustainably user understanding linkage salmon groundwater major focus salmon recovery planning central california increasingly throughout pacific northwest use extended field interview participant observation field ecology campaign regulatory forum explore water scarce salmon bearing watershed california central coast collaborator synthesizing agency landowner data groundwater salmon management focus three project undertaken scientist collaboration gold ridge resource conservation district staff salmonid census mapping wet dry stream reach well monitoring find collaborative research initiated local resident agency personnel case created sense ecological possibility region consider limitation collaboration namely lack indigenous pomo miwok tribal member confederated tribe graton rancheria farmworkers marginalized resident suggest strategy deepening environmental justice commitment future collaborative work
185,Preparing for flooding in England and Wales: the role of risk perception and the social context in driving individual action,2017-01-01,"Flooding is a major threat to the local communities in the UK, and the risks are increasing due to climate change. Encouraging homeowners to prepare for the consequences of catastrophic flooding is imperative. This study aims to examine the ways in which individuals' risk perceptions and socio-cultural characteristics co-determine the preparedness for flood hazards. It is based on a social survey about household arrangements that can reduce the economic losses arising from flooding and enhance community resilience. A total of 485 responses were solicited from homeowners in England and Wales. Results confirm that the intention to act is socially motivated. This indicates the need for addressing the role of social networks and engagement with local community in enhancing community resilience to flooding. On the other hand, the effect of risk-related considerations is complicated. Perceived severity of flood damage is associated with intended actions, whereas risk characteristics are not. This implies that although providing relevant risk information to the public is crucial, appealing to the feelings of fears and uncertainties is less likely to be effective in driving actions for managing flood risks than has been usually assumed. The findings have practical implications for policy-making and climate risk communication.",198,flooding major threat local community uk risk increasing due encouraging homeowner prepare consequence catastrophic flooding imperative aim examine way individual risk perception socio cultural characteristic co determine preparedness flood hazard based social survey household arrangement reduce economic loss arising flooding enhance community resilience total response solicited homeowner england wale result confirm intention act socially motivated indicates need addressing role social network local community enhancing community resilience flooding hand effect risk related consideration complicated perceived severity flood damage associated intended action whereas risk characteristic implies although providing relevant risk information crucial appealing feeling fear uncertainty le likely effective driving action managing flood risk usually assumed finding practical implication policy making risk communication
186,Local authorities and the engagement of private actors in climate change adaptation,2017-01-01,"The local level and private actors play an important role in the implementation of climate change adaptation. The engagement of the private sector and citizens has received increasing attention in recent years. Local authorities' choice of policy instruments, the distribution of responsibilities and the benefits of adaptation as a public or a private good have a bearing on the involvement of private actors. Based on interviews and documents from Copenhagen and Helsinki, we analyse how public authorities' choices, to whom and how they shift responsibilities, can foster transformational, participatory or market-oriented elements of adaptation. The results indicate that local authorities play a dominant role in providing adaptation. Public authorities steer where the private sector and citizens are expected to take responsibilities. This mix of top-down steering, market mechanisms and citizen involvement might reduce the advantages that a shift of responsibilities towards private actors could provide for the handling of climate change adaptation.",152,local level private actor play important role implementation private sector citizen received increasing attention recent year local authority choice policy instrument distribution responsibility benefit private good bearing involvement private actor based interview document copenhagen helsinki analyse authority choice shift responsibility foster transformational participatory market oriented element result indicate local authority play dominant role providing authority steer private sector citizen expected take responsibility mix top steering market mechanism involvement might reduce advantage shift responsibility towards private actor could provide handling
187,Social inequality and marginalization in post-disaster recovery: Challenging the consensus?,2017-01-01,"Disasters and subsequent recovery efforts often reinforce social inequality and marginalization, hampering sustainable development paths. This paper presents an analysis of inequality and marginalization effects of post-disaster reconstruction from a risk governance perspective. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the Fischerdorf and Natternberg districts of the German city of Deggendorf, severely affected by the 2013 floods in Europe. The findings show that social inequality and marginalization affected housing reconstruction (and vice versa) in unexpected ways. Uninsured groups (such as the elderly and migrant homeowners) received prompt, ad-hoc support from state and civil society actors, while insured homeowners (mostly higher-income groups) experienced ongoing disputes between state and market actors that hampered their recovery. Some marginalized groups could not access state support, as various aspects of cultural diversity were not adequately considered. This fostered, and created new, patterns of inequality and risk. The ad-hoc engagement of civil society was crucial, but insufficient, to fully buffer the effects of inequality and marginalization resulting from formal recovery processes. We conclude that it is critical to give more attention to the interplay, and power constellations, between state, market and civil society actors to facilitate sustainable recovery and development-by counteracting potential inequality and marginalization effects. Increased consideration of cultural diversity and the support of citizens who play dual roles (and can mediate between different actors) was identified to be vital in this context. We thus call for increased research into the issue of complementary city-citizen rights and responsibilities in risk reduction and adaptation planning.",248,disaster subsequent recovery effort often reinforce social inequality marginalization hampering sustainable development path present analysis inequality marginalization effect post disaster reconstruction risk governance perspective mixed method approach examine fischerdorf natternberg district german city deggendorf severely affected flood europe finding social inequality marginalization affected housing reconstruction vice versa unexpected way uninsured group elderly migrant homeowner received prompt ad hoc support state civil society actor insured homeowner mostly higher income group experienced ongoing dispute state market actor hampered recovery marginalized group could access state support various aspect cultural diversity adequately considered fostered created pattern inequality risk ad hoc civil society crucial insufficient fully buffer effect inequality marginalization resulting formal recovery process conclude critical give attention interplay power constellation state market civil society actor facilitate sustainable recovery development counteracting potential inequality marginalization effect increased consideration cultural diversity support citizen play dual role mediate different actor identified vital context thus call increased research issue complementary city right responsibility risk reduction planning

How EWE guidance is disseminated and applied across health and social care systems, at the local, operational level, is not well understood. Methods This exploratory study develops tools and resources to assist local stakeholders to cascade national 'all weather' EWE guidance across local systems. These resources are also used to evaluate the local interpretation and implementation of this advice and guidance within three local authority areas. In total, five discussion group meetings were held and 45 practitioners took part in the study. A thematic analysis was conducted. Results The main themes emerging from the analysis related to awareness of PHE guidance for EWE preparedness, data sharing feasibility, community engagement, specific conditions in remote rural areas and capacity of frontline staff. Conclusions The relative difficulty in finding where the study 'best fits' on local stakeholders' agendas suggests that year-round and preparedness planning for EWEs may not have been considered a high priority in participating areas.

We present a case study of the UK's National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies and explore stakeholder understanding, views, perceptions, opinions, and application within the East of England. A semi-structured interview methodology was adopted for this paper with 14 key stakeholders from across the East of England interviewed. Thematic coding analysis was used to structure the results against a set of research questions. Interviewees were found to be largely unaware of the National Risk Register, and as such its usefulness as a risk management tool is limited. In particular, restricted local resources, limited understanding of risk, and a lack of actionable strategies were highlighted as barriers to action. Opportunities for capacity building at the local level, sharing best practice, and improved risk communication were all identified.

The benefit of mobilising community level action in addressing climate change action has already been seen in many European countries. While Irish governmental policy envisions as necessary greater community involvement in energy projects and other efforts to reduce carbon emissions, little progress has been encouraging or supporting such action. Using the Q-method, this study examined and identified where commonalities exist in Irish communities that have successfully implemented sustainable development goals, in terms of their motivation, attitudes, perceived barriers and opportunities for continued action. Results indicate that participants' main motivations are derived from a sense of responsibility to future generations and the need to live more balanced lifestyles. Results further suggest that short-term central government strategy, poor support, bureaucracy, and a lack of collaboration are seen as key limitations in developing and achieving effective community level sustainability action. This study contributes in understanding how climate change policy can be aligned to the preferred future vision of communities in bringing about effective change in transitioning to a low-carbon society.",192,predicted despite previous reduction greenhouse gas emission ireland continue increase current level next year benefit mobilising community level action addressing action already seen many european country irish governmental policy envisions necessary greater community involvement energy project effort reduce carbon emission little progress encouraging supporting action q method examined identified commonality exist irish community successfully implemented sustainable development goal term motivation attitude perceived barrier opportunity continued action result indicate participant main motivation derived sense responsibility future generation need live balanced lifestyle result suggest short term central government strategy poor support bureaucracy lack collaboration seen key limitation developing achieving effective community level sustainability action contributes understanding policy aligned preferred future vision community bringing effective transitioning low carbon society
191,Construcciones de la psicología al abordaje de la dimensión humana del cambio climático en Chile (Segunda parte),2017-01-01,"Multiple studies show that the integration of social and psychological factors in the design, implementation and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation strategies is paramount to address the complexities of climate change. Such factors influence both the perception of the problem and the responses to it in every social system. Considering a multiple level approach that considers institutional, communitarian and personal dimensions the inclusion of these psychological aspects can help to increase the importance of climate change in society, favor a deeper community engagement, improving public policies, and strengthen individual, social and institutional resilience. Although Chile is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world regarding climate change impacts, presenting seven out of nine vulnerability criteria, the study of the social and psychological dimensions of climate change in our country is limited and its importance for policy-making generally unknown. In such a context we organized a literature review aimed at exploring how Psychology can contribute to address the human dimensions of climate change in Chile considering a wide range of topics. To do this a reasonable high number of specialized data -bases and scientific journals were used. As a result of this work we expect to encourage scholars from diverse disciplines, not only psychologists, to digdeeper on these issues in the Chilean and Latin American context to fill this gap in the knowledge. The literature review showed that most research has been conducted in developed countries such as United States, Australia and United Kingdom. This is expected considering the high levels of political polarization about climate change in those countries, either regarding the causes of the problem, the actions needed to address it, or even if it is happening or not. Contrariwise, we only found a reduced number of articles addressing specifically the psychological aspects of climate change in both Latin America and Chile. Interestingly, mainly scholars from other disciplines generally related to environmental management, planning, Sociology and other social sciences, rather than psychologists, have conducted those studies in the region, most of them focused on issues such as social vulnerability, inequalities, poverty alleviation, political participation and agriculture in rural and indigenous communities in the context of droughts or water management related issues. Results of this review are presented in two articles covering five main topics reflecting the most relevant issues identified in the interaction between psychological factors and climate change in the literature. This Second part follows the literature review presented in a previous article (First part). It starts with climate change related topics that are particularly relevant to Latino America mainly associated with social and environmental vulnerability and participation. Then we present an analysis of national and sectorial climate change plans developed in Chile during the last decade to identify the social and psychological aspects that need to be addressed in each of them. Similarly, multiple case studies conducted in Chile are presented to illustrate the importance of these issues. As a result, we propose a framework to organize and encourage research in this area and to integrate this knowledge in policy-making. Four general research topics are suggested: beliefs, values and attitudes; education and climate change awareness; citizen participation; and mental health and social wellbeing. Overall, this review suggests that Psychology's contributions to address climate change challenges will improve our understanding of the complex relationship between people and nature in general and society and climate change in particular. However, to have a significant impact in policy-making, psychological studies need to be part of wider multidisciplinary teams and work at multiple levels, especially close to communities and public institutions avoiding an excessive experimentalism and academicism preventing isolation from society.",600,multiple study integration social psychological factor design implementation evaluation mitigation strategy paramount address complexity factor influence perception problem response every social system considering multiple level approach considers institutional communitarian personal dimension inclusion psychological aspect help increase importance society favor deeper community improving policy strengthen individual social institutional resilience although chile vulnerable country world regarding impact presenting seven nine vulnerability criterion social psychological dimension country importance policy making generally unknown context organized literature review aimed exploring psychology contribute address human dimension chile considering wide range topic reasonable high number specialized data base scientific journal used work expect encourage scholar diverse discipline psychologist digdeeper issue chilean latin american context fill gap knowledge literature review showed research conducted developed country united state australia united kingdom expected considering high level political polarization country either regarding cause problem action needed address even happening contrariwise found reduced number article addressing specifically psychological aspect latin america chile interestingly mainly scholar discipline generally related environmental management planning sociology social science rather psychologist conducted study region focused issue social vulnerability inequality poverty alleviation political participation agriculture rural indigenous community context drought water management related issue result review presented article covering five main topic reflecting relevant issue identified interaction psychological factor literature second part follows literature review presented previous first part start related topic particularly relevant latino america mainly associated social environmental vulnerability participation present analysis national sectorial plan developed chile last decade identify social psychological aspect need addressed similarly multiple study conducted chile presented illustrate importance issue propose framework organize encourage research area integrate knowledge policy making four general research topic suggested belief value attitude education awareness participation mental health social wellbeing overall review suggests psychology contribution address challenge improve understanding complex relationship people nature general society particular however significant impact policy making psychological study need part wider multidisciplinary team work multiple level especially close community institution avoiding excessive experimentalism academicism preventing isolation society
192,"Moving beyond the metaphor, reaching beyond the rhetoric: Social work education in a changing environment",2017-01-01,"This article explores Australian social work's engagement with environmental concerns through a review of scholarly literature and professional documentation, and suggests the professional imagination and espoused professional identity of social work practice as expressed in Australian social work education share significant common ground with the concerns of sustainability education. This raises the question of why it is that social work has yet to infuse, embed, or otherwise engage with the adoption of the principles of education for sustainability. The review found that social work has developed some momentum in negotiating challenges emerging as a consequence of climate change and other forms of complexity, but remains educationally challenged by the imperatives that follow commitment to sustainability in practice. To move beyond the metaphorical sense in which social work has previously used the term 'environment' requires re-framing of social work education's purview, and rethinking of the approaches used to incorporate sustainability concerns into professional practice qualifications. Principles of inquiry based learning and sustainability education are suggested, as the next step towards integrating and embedding the concerns of the future with revised social work praxis.

193,Enacting collective support for the European integration: Participation in pro-integration action and preference for specific transnational acculturation strategies,2018-01-01,"We propose that collective support for European integration is mani-fested in 2 distinct forms: first, as engagement in socio-political action by citizens who seek to change their nation and its status in Europe. Second, it is manifested as a transnational acculturation process that impacts on both nations and their citizens. These processes potentially engage social identities at 3 levels: national, European and as supporters of the European integration. Here, we examine these different levels of identification as part of a model predicting collective support for the European integration. To capture the dimension of transnationality, we collected data from 2 Romanian samples, 1 of participants living in their country of origin (N=203), and 1 of participants living as migrants outside Romania (N=196). We found that identification as a pro-integration supporter flows from European and Romanian national identifications and is an excellent predictor of collective support for European integration in both its forms.

Situated in the context of urban planning, a critical arena for triggering climate transitions, the aim of this paper is to explore how Swedish property developers respond to climate change. Qualitative analyses of corporate policy documents and semi-structured interviews with property developers reveal a vast divergence between the written policies, where leadership ambitions are high, and how the practice of property development is discussed in interviews. In the latter, there is little evidence of property developers pursuing a forward-looking or cutting-edge climate change agenda. Instead, they are critical of increased public regulation for climate-oriented measures. Explanations both confirm previous studies, highlighting lack of perceived customer demand, uncertainty of financial returns and limited innovations, and add new elements of place-dependency suggesting that innovative and front-runner practices can only be realized in the larger urban areas. Municipalities seeking to improve their climate-oriented profile in urban planning by involving private property developers need to develop strategies to maneuver the variance in responses to increase the effectiveness of implementation.",197,increasingly expected private actor play role entrepreneur frontrunners implementing measure whereas empirical study position role private actor scarce situated context urban planning critical arena triggering transition aim explore swedish property developer respond qualitative analysis corporate policy document semi structured interview property developer reveal vast divergence written policy leadership ambition high practice property development discussed interview latter little evidence property developer pursuing forward looking cutting edge agenda instead critical increased regulation oriented measure explanation confirm previous study highlighting lack perceived customer demand uncertainty financial return innovation add element place dependency suggesting innovative front runner practice realized larger urban area municipality seeking improve oriented profile urban planning involving private property developer need develop strategy maneuver variance response increase effectiveness implementation

Public submissions to the inquiry closed on 4 August 2017 and, at the time of writing, some 59 submissions had been made by researchers, public-interest organisations and members of the public, including a number of geographers. A topic of profound significance, climate change and national security warrants deep and sustained public engagement such as that offered by the Senate Inquiry submission process. In this Thinking Space essay, I urge geographers, working in Australia and internationally, to make ongoing contributions to such engagements. The emerging debate about climate change and national security will likely amplify following the release of the Committee's report. Geographic data and analysis pertaining to various aspects of climate change and security are needed in order to shape policy directions and support evidence-based policy making.

Along the path towards an increase in climate resilience, a stimulating role is played by EU projects as well as by international climate networks such as the Covenant of Mayors Initiative on Climate Change Adaptation (Mayors Adapt), launched in 2014, and the new Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy which ""pledge to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and to adopt an integrated approach to tackling mitigation and adaptation to climate change"". These initiatives stimulate engagement and networking among cities and raise public awareness encouraging policy makers to take action to adapt to climate change.

198,Beliefs and values explain international differences in perception of solar radiation management: insights from a cross-country survey,2017-01-01,"Solar radiation management (SRM) aims to counteract the negative consequences of global warming and is considered for deployment in the event that mitigation and adaptation efforts appear insufficient. However, because the potential ecological and political side effects of SRM are not well understood, and because SRM will cross national boundaries, an international research perspective on the general public's perception of this technology is required. We conducted an online survey on the general public's perception and acceptance of SRM in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Our findings confirmed the need for an international perspective, as we found several cross-country differences. Chinese respondents, for example, indicated greater acceptance for SRM than their North American and European counterparts. Moreover, results of regression analyses on acceptance of SRM by country revealed that lower acceptability ratings for SRM in Canada and Europe were mostly related to stronger beliefs that SRM tampers with nature. Chinese respondents, by contrast, were more accepting of SRM when they held stronger beliefs that it may reduce the motivation to adopt burdensome climate change mitigation efforts. Although our research-and previous studies-suggest that opposition to SRM remains, dismissing the technology entirely on these grounds and without conducting a careful, cross-national, and transdisciplinary decision-support process to set up an international policy regime seems premature as people from countries that are less prepared to mitigate and adapt to climate change seem to be more supportive of SRM.",237,solar radiation management srm aim counteract negative consequence global warming considered deployment event mitigation effort appear insufficient however potential ecological political side effect srm well understood srm cross national boundary international research perspective general perception technology required conducted online survey general perception acceptance srm canada china germany switzerland uk usa finding confirmed need international perspective found several cross country difference chinese respondent example indicated greater acceptance srm north american european counterpart moreover result regression analysis acceptance srm country revealed lower acceptability rating srm canada europe mostly related stronger belief srm tamper nature chinese respondent contrast accepting srm held stronger belief may reduce motivation adopt burdensome mitigation effort although research previous study suggest opposition srm remains dismissing technology entirely ground without conducting careful cross national transdisciplinary decision support process set international policy regime seems premature people country le prepared mitigate adapt seem supportive srm
199,Contribuciones de la Psicología al abordaje de la dimensión humana del cambio climático en Chile (Primera parte),2017-01-01,"Multiple studies show that the integration of social and psychological factors in the design, implementation and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation strategies is paramount to address the complexities of climate change. Such factors influence both the perception of the problem and the responses to it in every social system. Considering a multi-level approach encompassing institutional, communitarian and personal dimensions, the inclusion of these psychological aspects can help to increase the importance of climate change in society, favor a deeper community engagement, improving public policies, and strengthen individual, social and institutional resilience. Although Chile is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world regarding climate change impacts, presenting seven out of nine vulnerability criteria, the study of the social and psychological dimensions of climate change in our country is limited and its importance for policy-making generally unknown. In such a context we organized a literature review aimed at exploring how Psychology can contribute to address the human dimensions of climate change in Chile considering a wide range of topics. To do this a reasonable high number of specialized databases and scientific journals were used. As a result of this work we expect to encourage scholars from diverse disciplines, not only psychologist, to dig deeper on these issues in the Chile an and Latin American context to fill this gap in the knowledge. The literature review showed that most research has been conducted in developed countries such as United States, Australia, and United Kingdom. This is expected considering the high levels of political polarization about climate change in those countries, either regarding the causes of the problem, the actions needed to address it, or even if it is happening or not. Contrariwise, we only found a reduced number of articles addressing specifically the psychological aspects of climate change in both Latin America and Chile. Interestingly, mainly scholars from other disciplines generally related to environmental management, planning, Sociology and other social sciences, rather than psychologists, have conducted those studies in the region, most of them focused on issues such as social vulnerability, inequalities, poverty alleviation, political participation and agriculture in rural and indigenous communities in the context of droughts or water management related issues. Results of this review are presented in two parts covering five main topics reflecting the most relevant issues identified in the interaction between psychological factors and climate change in the literature. Part one presents a short introduction on climate change impacts in Chile and the high level of vulnerability of our country given by geographic, environmental and social factors. Then we explain the link between Psychology and environmental problems in general, describing the main issues covered by two specialized sub disciplines called Environmental Psychology and Conservation Psychology. After that we present four sections summarizing the main findings of the literature review. These include the complexities of climate change communication; beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors; psychological drivers and barriers for climate change action; and the emergent study of the impacts of climate change and mental health. This sets the basis for a framework to organize and encourage research in this area and to integrate this knowledge in policy-making in the Chilean context. Overall, this review suggests that psychology's contributions to address climate change challenges will improve our understanding of the complex relationship between people and nature in general and society and climate change in particular. However, to have a significant impact in policy-making, psychological studies need to be part of wider multidisciplinary teams and work at multiple levels, specially close to communities and public institutions avoiding an excessive experimentalism and academicism preventing isolation from society.",596,multiple study integration social psychological factor design implementation evaluation mitigation strategy paramount address complexity factor influence perception problem response every social system considering multi level approach encompassing institutional communitarian personal dimension inclusion psychological aspect help increase importance society favor deeper community improving policy strengthen individual social institutional resilience although chile vulnerable country world regarding impact presenting seven nine vulnerability criterion social psychological dimension country importance policy making generally unknown context organized literature review aimed exploring psychology contribute address human dimension chile considering wide range topic reasonable high number specialized database scientific journal used work expect encourage scholar diverse discipline psychologist dig deeper issue chile latin american context fill gap knowledge literature review showed research conducted developed country united state australia united kingdom expected considering high level political polarization country either regarding cause problem action needed address even happening contrariwise found reduced number article addressing specifically psychological aspect latin america chile interestingly mainly scholar discipline generally related environmental management planning sociology social science rather psychologist conducted study region focused issue social vulnerability inequality poverty alleviation political participation agriculture rural indigenous community context drought water management related issue result review presented part covering five main topic reflecting relevant issue identified interaction psychological factor literature part present short introduction impact chile high level vulnerability country given geographic environmental social factor explain link psychology environmental problem general describing main issue covered specialized sub discipline called environmental psychology conservation psychology present four section summarizing main finding literature review include complexity communication belief value attitude behavior psychological driver barrier action emergent impact mental health set basis framework organize encourage research area integrate knowledge policy making chilean context overall review suggests psychology contribution address challenge improve understanding complex relationship people nature general society particular however significant impact policy making psychological study need part wider multidisciplinary team work multiple level specially close community institution avoiding excessive experimentalism academicism preventing isolation society

A parallel reading of the SSPs and the novels provides the means to make links between larger societal trends and personal accounts of climate change. The article shows how literary fiction creates engagement with climate change through particular accounts of agency and focalized perspectives in a different way than how the factors important to challenges of mitigation and adaptation are narrated in the SSPs.

201,Advancing values-based approaches to climate change adaptation: A case study from Australia,2017-01-01,"Coastal flooding affects physical and social place attachments. Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation examine how risks to place attachments are distributed within and among communities, with a view to informing equitable adaptation policies. In this nascent body of research, divergent theoretical frameworks and empirical approaches to measuring social values are evolving. While some studies explore the things people value about their everyday lives generally-the lived values approach, others locate specific social and cultural values in geographic space-the landscape values mapping approach. This study aims to compare the explanatory value of these two approaches for understanding the social risks of sea-level rise, and appraise whether either or both approaches are likely to meet local adaptation planning needs. It does this by examining the potential social impacts of sea-level rise in Kingston Beach, Australia, informed by a mail-out survey of the community. The lived values approach identified that the natural environment, scenery, relaxed lifestyle and safety are highly important to local residents, while the landscape values mapping approach revealed that Kingston Main Beach is the most highly valued of eight coastal landscape units. Incorporating the landscape values mapping into the lived values cluster analysis revealed that while Kingston Main Beach is highly important for its recreational value to some members of the community, for others manmade features such as community halls or sports ovals may be of higher importance because they facilitate social interactions. There is potential to further integrate these two approaches to better inform adaptation policy about how lived and landscape values are distributed among communities, where they are located in space and whether they change over time. A deeper understanding of such assigned values can lead to improved engagement with coastal residents to inform adaptation policy now and into the future.",293,coastal flooding affect physical social place attachment value based approach examine risk place attachment distributed within among community view informing equitable policy nascent body research divergent theoretical framework empirical approach measuring social value evolving study explore thing people value everyday life generally lived value approach others locate specific social cultural value geographic space landscape value mapping approach aim compare explanatory value approach understanding social risk sea level rise appraise whether either approach likely meet local planning need examining potential social impact sea level rise kingston beach australia informed mail survey community lived value approach identified natural environment scenery relaxed lifestyle safety highly important local resident landscape value mapping approach revealed kingston main beach highly valued eight coastal landscape unit incorporating landscape value mapping lived value cluster analysis revealed kingston main beach highly important recreational value member community others manmade feature community hall sport oval may higher importance facilitate social interaction potential integrate approach better inform policy lived landscape value distributed among community located space whether time deeper understanding assigned value lead improved coastal resident inform policy future
202,"Community-responsive adaptation to flooding in Kibera, Kenya",2017-01-01,"Much of the world's existing and future population will live in slums, where the twin trajectories of rapid urbanisation and increased flooding driven by climate change collide. Few spatial planning policies currently address this issue in practice. Poorly planned relocation from slum areas has caused conflict and insecurity, while large-scale infrastructural solutions for reducing flood risk are prohibitively expensive. There is a need to consider how local adaptation measures for increasing resilience to flooding can complement other structural and policy measures. This paper describes and evaluates autonomous, market-based and public-policy-driven structural and non-structural adaptation approaches to flooding in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. The analysis employs a novel survey data set from 963 households in Kibera and extensive community and institutional stakeholder consultation. Results of the consultation demonstrate how autonomous adaptation at the household level is disincentivised by insecure housing tenure, while public-policy-driven approaches are constrained by the lack of effective community engagement. Combining the lessons from this analysis with 10 years of experience in developing public space and infrastructure projects in Kibera, the paper builds the case for an approach to 'community-responsive adaptation' to urban flooding that negotiates these limitations.",194,much world existing future population live slum twin trajectory rapid urbanisation increased flooding driven collide spatial planning policy currently address issue practice poorly planned relocation slum area caused conflict insecurity scale infrastructural solution reducing flood risk prohibitively expensive need consider local measure increasing resilience flooding complement structural policy measure describes evaluates autonomous market based policy driven structural non structural approach flooding kibera largest informal settlement nairobi kenya analysis employ novel survey data set household kibera extensive community institutional stakeholder consultation result consultation demonstrate autonomous household level disincentivised insecure housing tenure policy driven approach constrained lack effective community combining lesson analysis year experience developing space infrastructure project kibera build approach community responsive urban flooding negotiates limitation
203,A methodological framework to operationalize climate risk management: managing sovereign climate-related extreme event risk in Austria,2017-01-01,"Despite considerable uncertainties regarding the exact contribution of anthropogenic climate change to disaster risk, rising losses from extreme events have highlighted the need to comprehensively address climate-related risk. This requires linking climate adaptation to disaster risk management (DRM), leading to what has been broadly referred to as climate risk management (CRM). While this concept has received attention in debate, important gaps remain in terms of operationalizing it with applicable methods and tools for specific risks and decision-contexts. By developing and applying a methodological approach to CRM in the decision context of sovereign risk (flooding) in Austria we test the usefulness of CRM, and based on these insights, inform applications in other decision contexts. Our methodological approach builds on multiple lines of evidence and methods. These comprise of a broad stakeholder engagement process, empirical analysis of public budgets, and risk-focused economic modelling. We find that a CRM framework is able to inform instrumental as well as reflexive and participatory debate in practice. Due to the complex interaction of social-ecological systems with climate risks, and taking into account the likelihood of future contingent climate-related fiscal liabilities increasing substantially as a result of socioeconomic developments and climate change, we identify the need for advanced learning processes and iterative updates of CRM management plans. We suggest that strategies comprising a portfolio of policy measures to reduce and manage climate-related risks are particularly effective if they tailor individual instruments to the specific requirements of different risk layers.",242,despite considerable uncertainty regarding exact contribution anthropogenic disaster risk rising loss extreme event highlighted need comprehensively address related risk requires linking disaster risk management drm leading broadly referred risk management crm concept received attention debate important gap remain term operationalizing applicable method tool specific risk decision context developing applying methodological approach crm decision context sovereign risk flooding austria test usefulness crm based insight inform application decision context methodological approach build multiple line evidence method comprise broad stakeholder process empirical analysis budget risk focused economic modelling find crm framework able inform instrumental well reflexive participatory debate practice due complex interaction social ecological system risk taking account likelihood future contingent related fiscal liability increasing substantially socioeconomic development identify need advanced learning process iterative update crm management plan suggest strategy comprising portfolio policy measure reduce manage related risk particularly effective tailor individual instrument specific requirement different risk layer
204,'Branching scenarios' seeking articulated action for regional regeneration - A case study of limited success,2017-01-01,"In this article, we outline and discuss a novel augmentation of scenario method combined with Delphi analysis to engage multiple actors in analyzing complex and contested problems. In particular, we present 'branching scenarios' as an approach that breaks potential chains of perceived causality from the national/global level to drive local outcomes. The approach focuses on generating debate on local agency. The project discussed formed part of a larger research program in North West Tasmania to study the possible processes for economic and social regeneration. In engaging key stakeholders from public, private and non-governmental organizations, the team faced issues associated with participants' geographical dispersal and lack of time. In addition, the region may be considered as characterized by 'lock-in' to extant structures and, perhaps, resistant to the change necessary to achieve economic regeneration. For these reasons, our scenario intervention was deliberately designed to provide a cognitive 'jolt' to these senior, time-poor individuals- seeking to prompt their articulated action to achieve the jointly-held goal, regeneration. We document our approach and evaluate and analyze the degree to which we achieved this jointly-desired outcome.

205,Impact of socio-demographic factors on the mitigating actions for climate change: a path analysis with mediating effects of attitudinal variables,2017-01-01,"Socio-demographic factors play a significant role in increasing the individual's climate change awareness and in setting a favorable individual attitude towards its mitigation. To better understand how the adversative effects of climate change can be mitigated, this study attempts to investigate the impact of socio-demographic factors on the mitigating actions of the individuals (MAOI) on climate change. Qualitative data were collected from a face-to-face survey of 360 respondents in the Kuala Lumpur region of Malaysia through a close-ended questionnaire. Analysis was conducted on the mediating effects of attitudinal variables through the path model by using the SEM. Findings indicate that the socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, education, income, and ethnicity can greatly influence the individual's awareness, attitude, risk perception, and knowledge of climate change issues. The results drawn from this study also revealed that the attitudinal factors act as a mediating effect between the socio-demographic factors and the MAOI, thereby, indicating that both the socio-demographic factors and the attitudinal factors have significant effects on the MAOI towards climate change. The outcome of this study can help policy makers and other private organizations to decide on the appropriate actions to take in managing climate change effects. These actions which encompass improving basic climate change education and making the public more aware of the local dimensions of climate change are important for harnessing public engagement and support that can also stimulate climate change awareness and promote mitigating actions to n protect the environment from the impact of climate change.",248,socio demographic factor play significant role increasing individual awareness setting favorable individual attitude towards mitigation better understand adversative effect mitigated attempt investigate impact socio demographic factor mitigating action individual maoi qualitative data collected face face survey respondent kuala lumpur region malaysia close ended questionnaire analysis conducted mediating effect attitudinal variable path model sem finding indicate socio demographic factor gender age education income ethnicity greatly influence individual awareness attitude risk perception knowledge issue result drawn revealed attitudinal factor act mediating effect socio demographic factor maoi thereby indicating socio demographic factor attitudinal factor significant effect maoi towards outcome help policy maker private organization decide appropriate action take managing effect action encompass improving basic education making aware local dimension important harnessing support stimulate awareness promote mitigating action n protect environment impact
206,Differentiating environmental concern in the context of psychological adaption to climate change,2018-01-01,"Despite existing evidence for the threats of climate change facing people living in the U.S., the psychological impacts of this threat have been neglected in public and scientific discourse, resulting in a notable lack in studies on individuals' adaptation to climate change. Using social-cognitive theory, we examine how three forms of environmental concern egoistic (e.g., concern for oneself; one's health or life), social-altruistic (e.g., concern for others; future generations or country), and biospheric (e.g., concern for plants and animals; nature) influence concurrent ecological stress and ecological coping strategies. Further, we examine how ecological stress and coping are associated with both depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. In an online survey of 342 U.S. adults we found unique patterns of the three forms of environmental concern. Only individuals higher in biospheric environmental concern perceived ecological stress and engaged in ecological coping. In contrast, individuals higher in social-altruistic concern did not perceive ecological stress, but did engage in ecological coping. Those higher in egoistic concern neither perceived ecological stress, nor engaged in coping. In addition, perceived ecological stress was positively associated with depressive symptoms; ecological coping negatively predicted depressive symptoms, while positively predicting pro-environmental behaviors. In sum, with the exception of those high in biospheric concern, study participants did not seem to perceive climate change threats as having a profound effect on their own or their family's life. Differentiating three forms of environmental concern provides a nuanced view on their association with ecological stress and coping, and in turn depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. Results indicate that current public policy approaches that often focus on the natural environment when depicting or explaining the effects of climate change, may limit the effectiveness of interventions to those people who already show high concern for all living creatures, while failing to affect those motivated by egoistic or altruistic concern, increasing the risks associated with delaying climate change adaptation and the potential for large-scale negative mental health effects in our society.",324,despite existing evidence threat facing people living u psychological impact threat neglected scientific discourse resulting notable lack study individual social cognitive theory examine three form environmental concern egoistic e g concern oneself health life social altruistic e g concern others future generation country biospheric e g concern plant animal nature influence concurrent ecological stress ecological coping strategy examine ecological stress coping associated depressive symptom pro environmental behavior online survey u adult found unique pattern three form environmental concern individual higher biospheric environmental concern perceived ecological stress engaged ecological coping contrast individual higher social altruistic concern perceive ecological stress engage ecological coping higher egoistic concern neither perceived ecological stress engaged coping addition perceived ecological stress positively associated depressive symptom ecological coping negatively predicted depressive symptom positively predicting pro environmental behavior sum exception high biospheric concern participant seem perceive threat profound effect family life differentiating three form environmental concern provides nuanced view association ecological stress coping turn depressive symptom pro environmental behavior result indicate current policy approach often focus natural environment depicting explaining effect may limit effectiveness intervention people already high concern living creature failing affect motivated egoistic altruistic concern increasing risk associated delaying potential scale negative mental health effect society

211,"Public-private partnership in enhancing farmers' adaptation to drought: Insights from the Lujiang Flatland in the Nu River (Upper Salween) valley, China",2018-01-01,"Agriculture is an important type of land use but suffers from drought, especially under global climate change scenarios. Although government is a major actor in helping farmers to adapt to drought, lack of funds has constrained its efforts. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mechanism has been widely applied in urban infrastructure development to raise fund for public goods and services, but very few studies explored its role in rural areas. Based on interview of 139 fanning households and open-ended interview of village heads, government officials and company representatives, in the Lujiang Flatland in the Nu River (Upper Salween) Valley, Southwest China, this paper aims to reveal how PPP functions to enhance farmers' adaptation to drought. We found that farmers have developed multiple strategies in their own ways to adapt to drought, including pumping and store water, using water-saving irrigation techniques, changing of crops, and strengthening water management at the community level, while insufficient funds, water resource scarcity and mismatch of time-scale of crop growth and drought even hindered their adaptation options. Limited fund sources, gap in policy implementation and weak performance of government-funded projects hindered governmental supports to be effective. Weak motivation and distrusted by farmers limited the engagement of private enterprises in supporting farmers to adapt to drought. PPP mechanism has the potential to mobilize fund from multiple sources, share costs, risks and benefits among different stakeholders, combine both scientific and local knowledge, and reduce uncertainty through formal and informal institutions. Benefited from these advantages, PPP mechanism could improve project performance, thus increase farmers' adaptation options and resilience to drought.

212,Participatory GIS as a Tool for Stakeholder Engagement in Building Resilience to Sea Level Rise: A Demonstration Project,2018-01-01,"This article describes a participatory geographical information system (PGIS) demonstration project used as part of the stakeholder engagement efforts undertaken by the Citizen Engagement Working Group of the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness and Resilience Intergovernmental Planning Pilot Project. The PGIS demonstration project was conducted in the Little Creek/Pretty Lake case study area in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern coastal Virginia. PGIS served as a deliberative and participatory mechanism to obtain local knowledge from residents about the location of valued assets within the community and locations challenged by increased flooding and sea level rise. The PGIS application, using the weTable tool, was found to be useful for soliciting and documenting local knowledge, such as by highlighting community assets and identifying community challenges. It was also found to be useful for facilitating community-wide discussion, visualizing the problem, and understanding the severity of sea level rise and flooding. The PGIS demonstration project showed how participatory mapping can directly engage residents in creating sociospatial data, build knowledge, and foster learning and deliberation in a complex issue such as resilience to flooding and sea level rise.",184,describes participatory geographical information system pgis demonstration project used part stakeholder effort undertaken working group hampton road sea level rise preparedness resilience intergovernmental planning pilot project pgis demonstration project conducted little creek pretty lake area hampton road region southeastern coastal virginia pgis served deliberative participatory mechanism obtain local knowledge resident location valued asset within community location challenged increased flooding sea level rise pgis application wetable tool found useful soliciting documenting local knowledge highlighting community asset identifying community challenge found useful facilitating community wide discussion visualizing problem understanding severity sea level rise flooding pgis demonstration project showed participatory mapping directly engage resident creating sociospatial data build knowledge foster learning deliberation complex issue resilience flooding sea level rise

To illuminate landowner perspectives on flood mitigation and the drivers of those perspectives, we surveyed landowners in the Deerfield River Watershed, Massachusetts (USA). Confirmatory factor analysis shows landowners differentiate between the physical and the policy pathways through which flood mitigation strategies provide protection. Multiple regression analyses indicate landowner support or opposition for each of those pathways is related both to the risks a landowner faces and to their broad worldviews. Lastly, cluster analysis indicates variation in patterns landowner of support or opposition to the physical and policy pathways through which flood mitigation provides protection.

214,Efficacy of a national hydrological risk communication strategy: Domestic wastewater treatment systems in the Republic of Ireland,2018-01-01,"A significant body of research has focused on the role of domestic wastewater treatment systems (DWWTSs) as sources of human-specific aquatic contaminants in both developed and developing regions. However, to date few studies have sought to investigate the awareness, attitudes and behaviours of DWWTS owners and the efficacy of associated communication initiatives. The current study provides an examination of a public national engagement campaign undertaken in the Republic of Ireland which seeks to minimise the impact of DWWTSs on human and ecological health via concurrent inspection and information dissemination. Overall, 1634 respondents were surveyed using a ""before and after"" study design to capture if and how awareness, attitudes and behaviours evolved over time. Findings suggest that whilst the campaign provided a modest baseline to raise general awareness associated with the basic operational and maintenance requirements of DWWTS, there has been little or no behavioural engagement as a result, suggesting a significant awareness-behaviour gap. Accordingly, efforts to minimise potential human and ecological, impacts have been unsuccessful. Moreover, results suggest that public attitudes towards water-related regulation and policy became increasingly negative over the study period due to parallel political and economic issues, further complicating future engagement. Future strategies, both in Ireland and further afield, should focus on health-based demographically-focused message framing to achieve significant knowledge and attitudinal shifts amongst specific population cohorts, and thus bring about significant behavioural change. Study findings and recommendations may be used by myriad stakeholders including local, provincial and national authorities to effectively engage with individuals and communities prior to and during implementation of legislative and policy-based instruments within numerous spheres including climate change adaptation, environmental quality, hydrological risk, and hydro-ecology.

215,A media framing analysis of urban flooding in Nigeria: current narratives and implications for policy,2018-01-01,"A critical element of current flood management is the importance of engaging key policy actors when policy decisions are to be made. However, there is still only limited understanding of how narratives of flood management actors may influence flood management policies, even though there is a suggestion that actors can strategically use their narratives to influence policy directions. In a developing country like Nigeria, there are still questions around lessons that can be learnt from understanding the narratives of policy actors, to unravel the complex nature of strategies and policy directions in managing urban floods. To help fill these gaps, this paper uses quantitative content analysis to explore the frame of five policy actor groups (government, local communities, business, multilateral organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)) as expressed in local and national newspapers between 2012 and 2016 to understand their narratives of causes and strategies to solve the problem of urban flooding in Nigeria. The narratives of government, local communities and businesses align with the premise that flooding can and should be prevented whilst that of multilateral and business actors champion adaptation strategies on the basis that flooding is inevitable and hence more energy should be directed at 'living with water'-emergency response, damage reduction and the aftermath. The study also identified areas of potential consensus and conflict between direct actors such as government and local communities on the one hand and funders on the other. Better discussion among actors aiding understanding of contemporary thinking and local realities will aid policy-making and policy implementation in the Nigerian context. An important step will be in the collaborative design of an urgently needed 'Nigerian policy on flooding' which currently does not exist.",278,critical element current flood management importance engaging key policy actor policy decision made however still understanding narrative flood management actor may influence flood management policy even though suggestion actor strategically use narrative influence policy direction developing country like nigeria still question around lesson learnt understanding narrative policy actor unravel complex nature strategy policy direction managing urban flood help fill gap us quantitative content analysis explore frame five policy actor group government local community business multilateral organisation non governmental organisation ngo expressed local national newspaper understand narrative cause strategy solve problem urban flooding nigeria narrative government local community business align premise flooding prevented whilst multilateral business actor champion strategy basis flooding inevitable hence energy directed living water emergency response damage reduction aftermath identified area potential consensus conflict direct actor government local community hand funders better discussion among actor aiding understanding contemporary thinking local reality aid policy making policy implementation nigerian context important step collaborative design urgently needed nigerian policy flooding currently exist
216,The Importance of Place in Communicating Climate Change to Different Facets of the American Public,2018-01-01,"While the need for action on climate change is urgent, individual-level behaviors to mitigate or adapt to the problem have not tracked with the increasing urgency for action. Place-based communication of climate change may catalyze action by making climate change more personally relevant. However, there is no one general public, so communication efforts can unintentionally polarize beliefs. This study aims to fill the gap in knowledge about how and why different audiences respond to place-based climate change communication, which could aid climate change communication efforts and climate scientists. Results from an experimental survey of 655 Californians and follow-up interviews indicate that prior climate change beliefs influence the effectiveness of place-based climate change communication. In particular, those who were already ""concerned'' about climate change, as classified by the Six Americas, were the only group to show a significant response to an intervention. This study also finds no difference in willingness to adapt to climate change between local and global framings. However, those exposed to a local framing were more likely to take personal-scale adaptation actions, while those exposed to a global framing were more likely to take policy-scale adaptation actions. These results, and the theories of place attachment and psychological distance, suggest that place-based communication may only be applicable for certain audiences (e.g., the concerned) and when the scale of the intervention matches the scale of action.",226,need action urgent individual level behavior mitigate adapt problem tracked increasing urgency action place based communication may catalyze action making personally relevant however general communication effort unintentionally polarize belief aim fill gap knowledge different audience respond place based communication could aid communication effort scientist result experimental survey californian follow interview indicate prior belief influence effectiveness place based communication particular already concerned classified six america group significant response intervention find difference willingness adapt local global framing however exposed local framing likely take personal scale action exposed global framing likely take policy scale action result theory place attachment psychological distance suggest place based communication may applicable certain audience e g concerned scale intervention match scale action

The case study uses Deliberation with Analysis, a process to integrate local residents' knowledge and values with local climate data, to create climate adaptation plans with two rural coastal Michigan communities. Iteration of the deliberative dialogue process is critical for allowing enough time for meaningful change and constructive communication to occur. Understanding where the community is starting from is important when tensions are high or deeply held values are challenged. Older techniques may need to be used to prepare the community for full participation in a deliberative process.

218,"How communication with teachers, family and friends contributes to predicting climate change behaviour among adolescents",2018-01-01,"Engaging adolescents is critical to encouraging future climate change adaptation and mitigation behaviours. Adolescents are typically more receptive to climate change messages than adults, but educators and communicators need research-based strategies for optimizing engagement, including information about what factors are most influential in changing behaviours. To better understand how communication with teachers, friends and family, climate change knowledge and climate change concern predict climate change behaviour, we administered a survey to a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1371). We measured climate change behaviour with a multi-item scale asking respondents about energy conservation, alternative transportation and engagement with environmental issues. We found that climate change concern and discussing climate change with family and friends predicted climate change behaviour. We also found that students from urban, high socioeconomic status schools were more likely to engage in climate change behaviour than students in urban, low socioeconomic status schools or rural schools. These results suggest that education efforts should leverage communication with family and friends in programming designed to encourage climate change behaviour. Further, efforts to promote climate change behaviour among low socioeconomic status urban and rural adolescents may be warranted, but would benefit from further investigation into the ideological, physical and knowledge-based drivers of behaviour differences documented in this study.",214,engaging adolescent critical encouraging future mitigation behaviour adolescent typically receptive message adult educator communicator need research based strategy optimizing including information factor influential changing behaviour better understand communication teacher friend family knowledge concern predict behaviour administered survey random sample middle school student north carolina usa n measured behaviour multi item scale asking respondent energy conservation alternative transportation environmental issue found concern discussing family friend predicted behaviour found student urban high socioeconomic status school likely engage behaviour student urban low socioeconomic status school rural school result suggest education effort leverage communication family friend programming designed encourage behaviour effort promote behaviour among low socioeconomic status urban rural adolescent may warranted would benefit investigation ideological physical knowledge based driver behaviour difference documented

However, given the major political, spatial, and scalar interdependencies involved, the extent to which these planning tools equip cities to realise 1.5 degrees C climate change scenarios is unclear. This article draws upon emerging knowledge in the fields of urban planning and urban climate governance to explore complementary insights into how cities can pursue ambitious and inclusive climate action to realise 1.5 degrees C climate change scenarios. We observe that urban planning scholarship is often under-appreciated in urban climate governance research, while conversely, promising urban planning tools and approaches can be limited by the contested realities of urban climate governance. By thematically reviewing diverse examples of urban climate action across the globe, we identify three key categories of planning dilemmas: institutional heterogeneity, scalar mismatch, and equity and justice concerns. We argue that lessons from urban planning and urban climate governance scholarship should be integrated to better understand how cities can realise 1.5 degrees C climate change scenarios in practice.",179,city around world facilitating ambitious inclusive action adopting participatory collaborative planning approach however given major political spatial scalar interdependency involved extent planning tool equip city realise degree c scenario unclear draw upon emerging knowledge field urban planning urban governance explore complementary insight city pursue ambitious inclusive action realise degree c scenario observe urban planning scholarship often appreciated urban governance research conversely promising urban planning tool approach contested reality urban governance thematically reviewing diverse example urban action across globe identify three key category planning dilemma institutional heterogeneity scalar mismatch equity justice concern argue lesson urban planning urban governance scholarship integrated better understand city realise degree c scenario practice

Using document analysis and interviews, an in-depth case study of two cities in the conservative Dallas-Fort Worth region of Texas examines how public participation and cultural framing contribute to sustainability and climate change planning. One city successfully adopted sustainability plans, while the other city was unable to do so. Comparison of the two cases reveals that carefully designed public participation processes and locally relevant cultural frames can help cities educate residents, build support and expand discussion of sustainability.

In this paper the case of Tenerife (in the Canary Islands) is analysed. Tenerife is a small island located northwest of the African continent, in the Atlantic Ocean. Tenerife presents a high vulnerability to heatwaves and Saharan dust events as a consequence of its closeness to the Saharan desert. In fact, increasing frequency of heatwaves and Saharan dust events has been reported and could worsen in the future due to global warming. An exploration of adaptation strategies to an increase of the frequency and intensity of these phenomena is therefore needed. Different social actors have been engaged in a participatory process aiming at exploring pathways for adaptation to extreme weather events. Resilience was argued as the relevant framing to address those hazards. Four focus group sessions were carried out in order to explore key transformative elements necessary to make resilient futures for Tenerife. The results highlight the need for broader climate-based policies across all sectors to assure that the island becomes resilient to climatic and non-climatic shocks.",184,considered crucial current society especially small island tenerife canary island analysed tenerife small island located northwest african continent atlantic ocean tenerife present high vulnerability heatwaves saharan dust event consequence closeness saharan desert fact increasing frequency heatwaves saharan dust event reported could worsen future due global warming exploration strategy increase frequency intensity phenomenon therefore needed different social actor engaged participatory process aiming exploring pathway extreme weather event resilience argued relevant framing address hazard four focus group session carried order explore key transformative element necessary make resilient future tenerife result highlight need broader based policy across sector assure island becomes resilient climatic non climatic shock
222,Planning support tools and their effects in participatory urban adaptation workshops,2018-01-01,"In the face of a changing climate, many cities are engaged in adaptation planning and are using participatory workshops to involve stakeholders in these initiatives. Different tools are being used to structure the process and content of participatory planning workshops, but it is unclear what effect the tools have on the workshops and their results. We evaluated three different tools (Group Model Building, the Adaptation Support Tool, and the Stress Test Guideline) and a tool-free approach in repeated simulated workshops, to observe and compare (1) the way workshops played out, and (2) the direct outcomes that were achieved. Tools appear to influence both aspects. Specifically, we measured differences in the learning effects in groups, in the development of shared understanding within groups, in the types of plans that are developed by groups, and in the nature of participation during the workshops. Further research is needed to translate these results into practice, but this is a first step in advancing knowledge about the influence of tools in participatory planning activities.

223,The relative importance of subjective and structural factors for individual adaptation to climate change by forest owners in Sweden,2018-01-01,"A growing body of literature argues that subjective factors can more accurately explain individual adaptation to climate change than objective measurers of adaptive capacity. Recent studies have shown that personal belief in climate change and affect are much better in explaining climate awareness and action than income, education or gender. This study focuses on the process of individual adaptation to climate change. It assesses and compares the influence of cognitive, experiential and structural factors on individuals' views and intentions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study comes from a survey with 836 forest owners in Sweden. Ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to test hypotheses about the different factors. Results show that cognitive factors-namely personal level of trust in climate science, belief in the salience of climate change and risk assessment-are the only statistically significant factors that can directly explain individuals' intention to adapt to climate change and their sense of urgency. Findings also suggest that structural or socio-demographic factors do not have a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among Swedish forest owners. The study also offers valuable insights for communication interventions to promote adaptation. Findings strongly suggest that communication interventions should focus more strongly on building trust and addressing stakeholders' individual needs and experiences.",208,growing body literature argues subjective factor accurately explain individual objective measurer adaptive capacity recent study personal belief affect much better explaining awareness action income education gender focus process individual ass compare influence cognitive experiential structural factor individual view intention regarding data come survey forest owner sweden ordinal binary logistic regression used test hypothesis different factor result cognitive factor namely personal level trust science belief salience risk assessment statistically significant factor directly explain individual intention adapt sense urgency finding suggest structural socio demographic factor statistically significant influence decision making among swedish forest owner offer valuable insight communication intervention promote finding strongly suggest communication intervention focus strongly building trust addressing stakeholder individual need experience

225,Characterizing uncertain sea-level rise projections to support investment decisions,2018-01-01,"Many institutions worldwide are considering how to include uncertainty about future changes in sea-levels and storm surges into their investment decisions regarding large capital infrastructures. Here we examine how to characterize deeply uncertain climate change projections to support such decisions using Robust Decision Making analysis. We address questions regarding how to confront the potential for future changes in low probability but large impact flooding events due to changes in sea-levels and storm surges. Such extreme events can affect investments in infrastructure but have proved difficult to consider in such decisions because of the deep uncertainty surrounding them. This study utilizes Robust Decision Making methods to address two questions applied to investment decisions at the Port of Los Angeles: (1) Under what future conditions would a Port of Los Angeles decision to harden its facilities against extreme flood scenarios at the next upgrade pass a cost-benefit test, and (2) Do sea-level rise projections and other information suggest such conditions are sufficiently likely to justify such an investment? We also compare and contrast the Robust Decision Making methods with a full probabilistic analysis. These two analysis frameworks result in similar investment recommendations for different idealized future sea-level projections, but provide different information to decision makers and envision different types of engagement with stakeholders. In particular, the full probabilistic analysis begins by aggregating the best scientific information into a single set of joint probability distributions, while the Robust Decision Making analysis identifies scenarios where a decision to invest in near-term response to extreme sea-level rise passes a cost-benefit test, and then assembles scientific information of differing levels of confidence to help decision makers judge whether or not these scenarios are sufficiently likely to justify making such investments. Results highlight the highly-localized and context dependent nature of applying Robust Decision Making methods to inform investment decisions.",302,many institution worldwide considering include uncertainty future change sea level storm surge investment decision regarding capital infrastructure examine characterize deeply uncertain projection support decision robust decision making analysis address question regarding confront potential future change low probability impact flooding event due change sea level storm surge extreme event affect investment infrastructure proved difficult consider decision deep uncertainty surrounding utilizes robust decision making method address question applied investment decision port los angeles future condition would port los angeles decision harden facility extreme flood scenario next upgrade pas cost benefit test sea level rise projection information suggest condition sufficiently likely justify investment compare contrast robust decision making method full probabilistic analysis analysis framework similar investment recommendation different idealized future sea level projection provide different information decision maker envision different type stakeholder particular full probabilistic analysis begin aggregating best scientific information single set joint probability distribution robust decision making analysis identifies scenario decision invest near term response extreme sea level rise pass cost benefit test assembles scientific information differing level confidence help decision maker judge whether scenario sufficiently likely justify making investment result highlight highly localized context dependent nature applying robust decision making method inform investment decision

227,Collaborative Governance for Climate Change Adaptation: Mapping citizen-municipality interactions,2018-01-01,"Increasing climate change impacts are a major threat to sustainable urban development, and challenge current governance structures, including actors' responsibilities for dealing with climate variability and extremes. The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing adaptation interactions' and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens - to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk - requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and responsibilisation'; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The health and productivity of ecosystems underpin agriculture, with stable ecosystems being the foundation for economic livelihoods and food security. This study proposes adaptation measures, using geospatial technology, for conserving natural resources and improving livelihoods of the local community from climate change scenarios. Planning, policy decisions and resultant programmes are required for natural resource management, which must be based on broad citizen participation and the engagement of rural communities. The suggested adaptation measures will help the planning system to regulate development of natural resources and the socio-economic environment. The major natural resources in the environment are land and water, both of which can be severely degraded by human interventions, as well as climate change. Various thematic maps are prepared with the use of geospatial technology, in order to be helpful for site-suitability analysis directed to the preparation of land and water management action plans for socio-economic development. The study area is a micro-watershed of the catchment of Ansupa Lake in the Cuttack District of Odisha, India. To reduce climate change impacts on natural resources and economic livelihoods, some adaptation measures have been proposed (e.g., 68.9ha for afforestation.; 13.94ha for gap plantations and agro-horticulture; 389.62ha for farm ponds and renovation of existing ponds for pisciculture and duckery activities, etc.; 11.33ha for land management, along with five bore wells, eight dug wells, 51 LBS/check dams, and four WHSs, etc., for water management for sustainable use).",244,cause environmental depletion threat global economy health productivity ecosystem underpin agriculture stable ecosystem foundation economic livelihood food security proposes measure geospatial technology conserving natural resource improving livelihood local community scenario planning policy decision resultant programme required natural resource management must based broad participation rural community suggested measure help planning system regulate development natural resource socio economic environment major natural resource environment land water severely degraded human intervention well various thematic map prepared use geospatial technology order helpful site suitability analysis directed preparation land water management action plan socio economic development area micro watershed catchment ansupa lake cuttack district odisha india reduce impact natural resource economic livelihood measure proposed e g ha afforestation ha gap plantation agro horticulture ha farm pond renovation existing pond pisciculture duckery activity etc ha land management along five bore well eight dug well lb check dam four whss etc water management sustainable use

Sea-level rise is a dynamic and uncertain process, which is deeply uncertain towards the latter part of this century and beyond.

We first discuss the nature of the sea-level problem, the policy context that creates decision-making challenges and how they have been typically addressed through policy and practice. Secondly, we show how an assessment and planning approach, designed to address uncertainty and change (the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) planning approach), has been integrated into national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change decision making in New Zealand. The Guidance integrates hazard and sea-level rise assessments with uncertainty type and with the scale and scope of activity.

However, a gap remains between public understanding, scientific knowledge about climate change, and changes in behaviour to effect adaptation. 'Serious games'-games used for purposes other than entertainment-are one way to reduce this adaptation deficit by enhancing opportunities for social learning and enabling positive action. Games can provide communities with the opportunity to interactively explore different climate futures, build capability and capacity for dealing with complex challenges, and socialise adaptation priorities with diverse publics. Using systematic review methods, this paper identifies, reviews, synthesises and assesses the literature on serious games for climate change adaptation. To determine where and how impact is achieved, we draw on an evaluation framework grounded in social learning, to assess which combinations of cognitive (knowledge and thinking), normative (norms and approaches) and relational (how people connect and network building) learning are achieved. Results show that factors influencing the overall success in influencing behaviour and catalysing learning for adaptation include generating high levels of interand intra-level trust between researchers, practitioners and community participants; strong debriefing and evaluation practices; and the use of experienced and knowledgeable facilitators. These results can help inform future game design, and research methodologies to develop robust ways for engaging with stakeholders and end users, and enhance learning effects for resilient climate futures.",230,already adverse impact ecosystem community economic activity higher temperature prolonged drought frequent extreme however gap remains understanding scientific knowledge change behaviour effect serious game game used purpose entertainment way reduce deficit enhancing opportunity social learning enabling positive action game provide community opportunity interactively explore different future build capability capacity dealing complex challenge socialise priority diverse public systematic review method identifies review synthesis ass literature serious game determine impact achieved draw evaluation framework grounded social learning ass combination cognitive knowledge thinking normative norm approach relational people connect network building learning achieved result factor influencing overall success influencing behaviour catalysing learning include generating high level interand intra level trust researcher practitioner community participant strong debriefing evaluation practice use experienced knowledgeable facilitator result help inform future game design research methodology develop robust way engaging stakeholder end user enhance learning effect resilient future
233,Business attitudes towards funding ecosystem services provided by urban forests,2018-01-01,"Urban trees and woodlands provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) to society, for example, flood risk reduction, air purification, and moderation of urban heat islands. Despite this, local government budgets for tree planting and maintenance have declined in many cities throughout the world. Thus far, the academic literature has largely ignored whether businesses are willing to help fund urban forests and the ES they provide. Business financing via payments for ecosystem services (PES) within the urban realm is also under-researched and lacking in practice. This study aims to address these research gaps. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 30 businesses of varying sizes and sectors, operating in Southampton, UK. Respondents thought a public-private partnership would be feasible, with a focus on voluntary payments towards enhancing air quality, reducing flood risk, and improving aesthetics. Respondents would prefer to choose from a list of location-specific, cost-effective, monitored projects to fund directly, for marketing and/or corporate social responsibility purposes. To facilitate business funding of urban forest-based ES, clear communication of the expected environmental benefits and a strong business case are required, drawing on the experience of similar initiatives. From our findings, we recommend the piloting and analysis of such PES schemes.",200,urban tree woodland provide wide range ecosystem service e society example flood risk reduction air purification moderation urban heat island despite local government budget tree planting maintenance declined many city throughout world thus far academic literature largely ignored whether business willing help fund urban forest e provide business financing via payment ecosystem service pe within urban realm researched lacking practice aim address research gap semi structured interview carried business varying size sector operating southampton uk respondent thought private partnership would feasible focus voluntary payment towards enhancing air quality reducing flood risk improving aesthetic respondent would prefer choose list location specific cost effective monitored project fund directly marketing corporate social responsibility purpose facilitate business funding urban forest based e clear communication expected environmental benefit strong business required drawing experience similar initiative finding recommend piloting analysis pe scheme

But as population growth and the effects of climate change put pressure on existing water sources, new innovations combined with social adaptations will be required. This commentary offers three suggestions for moving toward urban water sustainability in Hong Kong. The suggestions are: diversify sources of water while minimising dependence on desalination, foster public engagement with water and implement water-sensitive urban design. These suggestions are not intended to be a panacea but to augment existing measures that when combined can move toward the attainment of urban water sustainability.",104,several decade hong kong implemented number technological innovation securing water supply population growth effect put pressure existing water source innovation combined social adaptation required commentary offer three suggestion moving toward urban water sustainability hong kong suggestion diversify source water minimising dependence desalination foster water implement water sensitive urban design suggestion intended panacea augment existing measure combined move toward attainment urban water sustainability
235,"An Assessment of the Relationships between Extreme Weather Events, Vulnerability, and the Impacts on Human Wellbeing in Latin America",2018-01-01,"Climate change and variability are known to have an influence on human wellbeing in a variety of ways. In Latin America, such forces are especially conspicuous, particularly in respect of extreme climatological, hydrological, and weather events (EWEs) and climate-sensitive disasters (CSDs). Consistent with the need to study further such connections, this paper presents an analysis of some of the vulnerabilities of environmental health issues and climate-related impacts that are focusing on EWEs and CSDs in Latin American countries. The research includes an analysis of the (i) human and socio-economic development; (ii) geographical and socio-economic determinants of vulnerability and adaptability of environmental health issues (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity); (iii) occurrence of CSDs from 1988 to 2017 and their direct impacts on human wellbeing (Total death and Affected people); (iv) an online survey on the perceptions of the effects of EWEs on human wellbeing in a sample of countries in the region; and (v) discussion of possible solutions. The socio-economic and development indices, and the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) and Climate-Risk Index (CRI) disaster statistics suggest that the impacts of CSDs are primarily related to socio-economic determinants of human wellbeing and health inequalities. Also, >80% respondents to the survey say that the leading causes of climate-related human impacts are the lack of (i) public awareness; (ii) investment and (iii) preparedness. The paper concludes by adding some suggestions that show how countries in Latin America may better cope with the impacts of Climate-sensitive Disasters.",242,variability known influence human wellbeing variety way latin america force especially conspicuous particularly respect extreme climatological hydrological weather event ewe sensitive disaster csds consistent need connection present analysis vulnerability environmental health issue related impact focusing ewe csds latin american country research includes analysis human socio economic development ii geographical socio economic determinant vulnerability adaptability environmental health issue exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity iii occurrence csds direct impact human wellbeing total death affected people online survey perception effect ewe human wellbeing sample country region v discussion possible solution socio economic development index international disaster database em dat risk index cri disaster statistic suggest impact csds primarily related socio economic determinant human wellbeing health inequality respondent survey say leading cause related human impact lack awareness ii investment iii preparedness concludes adding suggestion country latin america may better cope impact sensitive disaster
236,Psychosocial drivers for change: Understanding and promoting stakeholder engagement in local adaptation to climate change in three European Mediterranean case studies,2018-01-01,"Stakeholder engagement in the processes of planning local adaptation to climate change faces many challenges. The goal of this work was to explore whether or not the intention of engaging could be understood (Study 1) and promoted (Study 2), by using an extension of the theory of planned behaviour. In Study 1, stakeholders from three European Mediterranean case studies were surveyed: Baixo Vouga Lagunar (Portugal), SCOT Provence Mediterranee (France), and the island of Crete (Greece) (N = 115). Stakeholders' intention of engaging was significantly predicted by subjective norm (which was predicted by injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and stakeholders) and by perceived behavioural control (which was predicted by knowledge of policy and instruments). Study 2 was conducted in the Baixo Vouga Lagunar case study and consisted of a two-workshop intervention where issues on local and regional adaptation, policies, and engagement were presented and discussed. A within-participants comparison of initial survey results with results following the workshops (N-T1 = 12, N-T2 = 15, N-T3 = 12) indicated that these were successful in increasing stakeholders' intention of engaging. This increase was paired with a) an increase in injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and consequently in subjective norm, and to b) a decrease in perceived complexity of planning local adaptation and an increase in knowledge regarding adaptation to climate change.",217,stakeholder process planning local face many challenge goal work explore whether intention engaging could understood promoted extension theory planned behaviour stakeholder three european mediterranean study surveyed baixo vouga lagunar portugal scot provence mediterranee france island crete greece n stakeholder intention engaging significantly predicted subjective norm predicted injunctive normative belief towards policy maker stakeholder perceived behavioural control predicted knowledge policy instrument conducted baixo vouga lagunar consisted workshop intervention issue local regional policy presented discussed within participant comparison initial survey result result following workshop n n n indicated successful increasing stakeholder intention engaging increase paired increase injunctive normative belief towards policy maker consequently subjective norm b decrease perceived complexity planning local increase knowledge regarding
237,Enhancing Climate Change Research With Open Science,2018-01-01,"Climate change research aims to understand global environmental change and how it will impact nature and society. The broad scope of climate change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018), individual data ownership (Hampton et al., 2015), and inefficient research workflows (Lowndes et al., 2017). Furthermore, the level of public interest and policy engagement on climate change issues relies on fast communication of academic research to public institutions, with the result that the societal impact of climate change studies will differ according to their public availability and exposure. Here, we argue that by adopting open science (OS) principles, scientists can advance climate change research and accelerate efforts to mitigate impacts; especially for highly vulnerable developing regions of the world where research capacity is limited. We underscore the specific benefits of OS in raising the academic and societal impact of climate change research using citation and media metrics.",207,research aim understand global environmental impact nature society broad scope impact mean successful mitigation effort require unprecedented collaboration effort unites diverse discipline able rapidly respond evolving issue ipcc however achieve aim research practice need updating key research finding remain behind journal paywalls scientific progress impeded low level reproducibility transparency ellison morueta holme et al individual data ownership hampton et al inefficient research workflow lowndes et al furthermore level interest policy issue relies fast communication academic research institution societal impact study differ according availability exposure argue adopting open science o principle scientist advance research accelerate effort mitigate impact especially highly vulnerable developing region world research capacity underscore specific benefit o raising academic societal impact research citation medium metric
238,From network to meshwork: Becoming attuned to difference in transdisciplinary environmental research encounters,2018-01-01,"Transdisciplinary research has been promoted as a means of bringing together certified experts and stakeholders to produce knowledge that is policy-relevant, salient, credible, and legitimate to inform decision-making about complex problems. In this article I discuss the limitations of using the 'network' metaphor in transdisciplinary research practice and propose the use of a different metaphor to make transdisciplinary research encounters more attuned to difference. This research is informed by Tim Ingold's use of 'meshwork' as a metaphor for how life is lived along lines of becoming: emergent, indeterminate, contingent, historical, narrative. In this paper, my objective is to explain and illustrate by way of an example of a transdisciplinary climate change adaptation project the need for a new metaphor to convey the open-endedness of transdisciplinary research where subject positions are not conceived in advance of a research encounter, such as in the 'network' metaphor, but erupt in the interstices of research methods, objectives and desired outcomes.

239,Towards a climate change adaptation strategy for national parks: Adaptive management pathways under dynamic risk,2018-01-01,"Government seeks to manage public protected areas, such as national parks, to conserve high-quality wildlife habitats and provide essential ecosystems services at risk of permanent damage or extinction from climate change. The complexity of the organizational structure required to deliver this breadth of functions, coupled to uncertainty surrounding the onset and severity of climate impacts at local scale, impedes planning for climate change. This paper describes the development of an adaptation planning tool and its application in a pilot planning process for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the agency of the New South Wales (NSW) Government (Australia) responsible for management of national parks and public conservation reserves. The process involved close engagement in knowledge co-production in participatory workshops, and employed two complementary techniques, adaptive pathways and risk assessment. It successfully elicited tacit knowledge of agency staff about the range of interventions available, the need for management practices to evolve, and of discontinuities in management pathways in a dynamic risk environment. Findings suggest that management effort across the NSW reserve system will increase as climate risk rises. Consequently, government will need to respond to increased demand for resources, for better targeting of those resources, and for management innovation in how resources are deployed to support adaptation that is both anticipatory and transformative.",212,government seek manage protected area national park conserve high quality wildlife habitat provide essential ecosystem service risk permanent damage extinction complexity organizational structure required deliver breadth function coupled uncertainty surrounding onset severity impact local scale impedes planning describes development planning tool application pilot planning process national park wildlife service agency south wale nsw government australia responsible management national park conservation reserve process involved close knowledge co production participatory workshop employed complementary technique adaptive pathway risk assessment successfully elicited tacit knowledge agency staff range intervention available need management practice evolve discontinuity management pathway dynamic risk environment finding suggest management effort across nsw reserve system increase risk rise consequently government need respond increased demand resource better targeting resource management innovation resource deployed support anticipatory transformative
240,An institutional analysis to address climate change adaptation in Tenerife (Canary Islands),2018-01-01,"Heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks have been acquiring more frequency and intensity in the Canary Islands during the last decades. Both climatic hazards are known to produce impacts on human health such as mortality (due to heat waves) and morbidity (due to dusty weather). This work addresses possible climate adaptation policies in Tenerife assuming the increasing impact of heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks in the island under a climate change scenario. It explores the institutional setting of climate change adaptation planning in Tenerife and evaluates the statu quo of adaptation planning in the island through the engagement of key social actors. An historical review of the local and regional press articles and legislation, an in-depth round of interviews, together with questionnaires to the main social actors allows framing the social and political context in which climate change adaptation in Tenerife is embedded. Key social actors were engaged, including international organisations, atmospheric research centres, local Universities, regional and insular governments, trade unions, and environmental NGOs, among others. The main obstacles mentioned by the social actors that hinder the development of an effective climate adaptation policy address scientific knowledge, data collection and policy making, focusing on the uncertainty of climate models, the lack of epidemiological data and contrasting opinions regarding the existing climate adaptation policies. Public participation, mainstreaming of climate policies and an integrated approach between mitigation and adaptation plans were identified as key policy issues. The outcomes of this study could be meaningful for climate adaptation initiatives at local or regional level, such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, that intend to promote climate resilience through the setup of climate adaptation strategies and plans at municipality level.",278,heat wave saharan dust outbreak acquiring frequency intensity canary island last decade climatic hazard known produce impact human health mortality due heat wave morbidity due dusty weather work address possible policy tenerife assuming increasing impact heat wave saharan dust outbreak island scenario explores institutional setting planning tenerife evaluates statu quo planning island key social actor historical review local regional press article legislation depth round interview together questionnaire main social actor allows framing social political context tenerife embedded key social actor engaged including international organisation atmospheric research centre local university regional insular government trade union environmental ngo among others main obstacle mentioned social actor hinder development effective policy address scientific knowledge data collection policy making focusing uncertainty model lack epidemiological data contrasting opinion regarding existing policy participation mainstreaming policy integrated approach mitigation plan identified key policy issue outcome could meaningful initiative local regional level global covenant mayor intend promote resilience setup strategy plan municipality level

The best technological solutions will only be effective if combined with behavior changes placing climate change at the forefront of our socio-cultural consciousness. Education is central in creating such a shift. Climate researchers have an important role in aiding the uptake of climate change education in U.S. public schools, where educators are often untrained and uncomfortable teaching the subject. This paper assesses the efficacy of implementing an interdisciplinary, experiential climate change curriculum in school garden classrooms in terms of student climate literacy and teacher professional development. The questions of how to teach and research climate education are explored via a participatory research project with schools in Oakland, CA and Lopez Island, WA. Initial results show improvement in student learning and engagement as well as teacher preparation. Both qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed through student surveys, teacher interviews, and site observation; however, further qualitative methodologies to study process of climate and energy literacy development are needed.

242,The MJA-Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: Australian policy inaction threatens lives,2018-01-01,"Climate plays an important role in human health and it is well established that climate change can have very significant impacts in this regard. In partnership with The Lancet and the MJA, we present the inaugural Australian Countdown assessment of progress on climate change and health. This comprehensive assessment examines 41 indicators across five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. These indicators and the methods used for each are largely consistent with those of the Lancet Countdown global assessment published in October 2017, but with an Australian focus. Significant developments include the addition of a new indicator on mental health. Overall, we find that Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In a number of respects, Australia has gone backwards and now lags behind other high income countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom. Examples include the persistence of a very high carbon-intensive energy system in Australia, and its slow transition to renewables and low carbon electricity generation. However, we also find some examples of good progress, such as heatwave response planning. Given the overall poor state of progress on climate change and health in Australia, this country now has an enormous opportunity to take action and protect human health and lives. Australia has the technical knowhow and intellect to do this, and our annual updates of this assessment will track Australia's engagement with and progress on this vitally important issue.",267,play important role human health well established significant impact regard partnership lancet mja present inaugural australian countdown assessment progress health comprehensive assessment examines indicator across five broad section impact exposure vulnerability planning resilience health mitigation action health co benefit economics finance political indicator method used largely consistent lancet countdown global assessment published october australian focus significant development include addition indicator mental health overall find australia vulnerable impact health policy inaction regard threatens australian life number respect australia gone backwards lag behind high income country germany united kingdom example include persistence high carbon intensive energy system australia slow transition renewables low carbon electricity generation however find example good progress heatwave response planning given overall poor state progress health australia country enormous opportunity take action protect human health life australia technical knowhow intellect annual update assessment track australia progress vitally important issue
243,Mapping Discourses of Climate Change Adaptation in the United Kingdom,2019-01-01,"The concept of adaptation is becoming part of mainstream public discourse on climate change. Yet the diversity, complexity, and novelty of the adaptation concept itself leads to interpretive flexibility, differing public understanding of (and engagement with) adaptation strategies, and hence differentiated policy responses. The boundary work of communicative practices and public understanding of the adaptation concept therefore requires empirical analysis in different cases and contexts. This study employs Q-methodology (a combined quantitative-qualitative social research method) to reveal the typologies of perspectives that emerge around the adaptation concept among a diverse group of citizen-stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Four such typologies are identified under the labels 1) top-down climate action, 2) collective action on climate change, 3) optimistic, values-focused adaptation, and 4) adaptation skepticism. The division between these perspectives reveals a perceived responsibility gap between the governmental-institutional and/or individual-community levels. Across the emergent discourses we find a consensual call for a multisector, multiscalar, and multistakeholder-led approach that posits adaptation as a contemporary, intragenerational problem, with a strong emphasis upon managing extreme weather events, and not as an abstract future problem. By attending to these public discourses in climate policy, this presents a potential means to lessen such a responsibility gap.",199,concept becoming part mainstream discourse yet diversity complexity novelty concept lead interpretive flexibility differing understanding strategy hence differentiated policy response boundary work communicative practice understanding concept therefore requires empirical analysis different case context employ q methodology combined quantitative qualitative social research method reveal typology perspective emerge around concept among diverse group stakeholder united kingdom four typology identified label top action collective action optimistic value focused skepticism division perspective reveals perceived responsibility gap governmental institutional individual community level across emergent discourse find consensual call multisector multiscalar multistakeholder led approach posit contemporary intragenerational problem strong emphasis upon managing extreme weather event abstract future problem attending discourse policy present potential mean lessen responsibility gap

However, a cohesive conceptual and empirical-based understanding of what governance capacity implies, how to measure it, and what cities can learn, is largely lacking. Understanding the influence of context is critical to address this issue. Accordingly, we aim to identify crosscutting contextual factors and how they prioritise different elements of governance capacity to address urban flood risk. In doing so, a framework of nine conditions and 27 indicators is applied in two Dutch cities and two cities in the United Kingdom. Three crosscutting contextual factors are identified that may explain differences in capacity-development priorities: (1) flood probability and impact; (2) national imposed institutional setting; and, (3) level of authority to secure long-term financial support. Capacity-priorities include, the recent political devolution in the UK, which emphasizes the role of citizen awareness, stakeholder engagement, entrepreneurial agents, and the overall necessity for local capacity-development. The Dutch focus on flood safety through centralised public coordination reduces flood probability but inhibits incentives to reduce flood impacts and lowers public awareness. In conclusion, the three identified contextual factors enable a better understanding of capacity-building priorities and may facilitate learning between cities.",198,sea level rise increased storm event urge city develop governance capacity however cohesive conceptual empirical based understanding governance capacity implies measure city learn largely lacking understanding influence context critical address issue accordingly aim identify crosscutting contextual factor prioritise different element governance capacity address urban flood risk framework nine condition indicator applied dutch city city united kingdom three crosscutting contextual factor identified may explain difference capacity development priority flood probability impact national imposed institutional setting level authority secure long term financial support capacity priority include recent political devolution uk emphasizes role awareness stakeholder entrepreneurial agent overall necessity local capacity development dutch focus flood safety centralised coordination reduces flood probability inhibits incentive reduce flood impact lower awareness conclusion three identified contextual factor enable better understanding capacity building priority may facilitate learning city
247,Effectiveness of gaming for communicating and teaching climate change,2018-01-01,"Games are increasingly proposed as an innovative way to convey scientific insights on the climate-economic system to students, non-experts, and the wider public. Yet, it is not clear if games can meet such expectations. We present quantitative evidence on the effectiveness of a simulation game for communicating and teaching international climate politics. We use a sample of over 200 students from Germany playing the simulation game KEEP COOL. We combine pre- and postgame surveys on climate politics with data on individual in-game decisions. Our key findings are that gaming increases the sense of personal responsibility, the confidence in politics for climate change mitigation, and makes more optimistic about international cooperation in climate politics. Furthermore, players that do cooperate less in the game become more optimistic about international cooperation but less confident about politics. These results are relevant for the design of future games, showing that effective climate games do not require climate-friendly in-game behavior as a winning condition. We conclude that simulation games can facilitate experiential learning about the difficulties of international climate politics and thereby complement both conventional communication and teaching methods.",183,game increasingly proposed innovative way convey scientific insight economic system student non expert wider yet clear game meet expectation present quantitative evidence effectiveness simulation game communicating teaching international politics use sample student germany playing simulation game keep cool combine pre postgame survey politics data individual game decision key finding gaming increase sense personal responsibility confidence politics mitigation make optimistic international cooperation politics furthermore player cooperate le game become optimistic international cooperation le confident politics result relevant design future game showing effective game require friendly game behavior winning condition conclude simulation game facilitate experiential learning difficulty international politics thereby complement conventional communication teaching method
248,A new framework to analyse workforce contribution to Australian cotton farm adaptability,2018-01-01,"Farmers face many challenges, including climate variability, that require continual adaptation. However, studies of farm adaptation have paid limited attention to the farm workforce, despite changes in farm workforce organisation (i.e. the number, type and forms of employment on farm) being a significant feature of agricultural change globally. To effectively support farmers' adaptation, it is important to understand farmers' workforce strategies (i.e. how farm workforce organisation supports the needs and priorities of the farm), how workforce choices are made and the implications for adaptation. This paper progresses a framework for analysing farm adaptability, including the farm workforce. Bringing together theories of livelihoods analysis and strategic human resource management, the farm workforce strategies of 16 case study farms in the Australian cotton production sector are analysed. Cotton production is exposed to major resource constraints, such as irrigation water. We interviewed farmers and collected data on farm business performance, workforce organisation choices, human resource management practices and employees' experiences of work. We integrated data to characterise farm workforce decision-making and the relationship between workforce strategies and farm adaptability for each farm. A cross-case analysis explored differences between farms. A diversity of workforce strategies was found, involving combinations of workforce options, defined as 'core', 'contract' and 'casual' workers at different levels of skills and experience. Farm workforce strategies were found to influence and be influenced by sources of financial capital, irrigation water availability/holdings, farm remoteness, new farm infrastructure and human resource management practices. The farm workforce was a response option to provide production flexibility, yet high adaptability was associated with some negative consequences for managers and employees. We show for the first time the influence of farm workforce organisation dynamics in adaptation and negative consequences of high farm adaptability.

251,Mapping Out Climate Change: Assessing How Coastal Communities Adapt Using Alternative Future Scenarios,2018-01-01,"Coastal communities are increasingly experiencing climate change-induced coastal disasters and chronic flooding and erosion. Decision makers and the public alike are struggling to reconcile the lack of ""fit"" between a rapidly changing environment and relatively rigid governance structures. In efforts to bridge this environment-governance gap in Tillamook County, Oregon, stakeholders formed a knowledge-to-action network (KTAN). The KTAN examined alternative future coastal policy and climate scenarios through extensive stakeholder engagement and the spatially explicit agent-based modeling framework Envision. The KTAN's results were further evaluated through a two-step mixed methods approach. First, KTAN-identified metrics were quantitatively assessed and compared under present-day vs. alternative policy scenarios. Second, the feasibility of implementing these policy scenarios was qualitatively evaluated through a review of governmental regulations and semistructured interviews. The findings show that alternative policy scenarios ranged from significantly beneficial to extremely harmful to coastal buildings and beach accessibility in comparison to present-day policies, and they were relatively feasible to almost impossible to implement. Beneficial policies that lower impacts of flooding and erosion clearly diverge from the existing regulatory environment, which inhibits their implementation. In response, leadership and cross-sector cooperation and coordination can help to overcome mixed interests and motivations, and increase information exchange between and within the public and government organizations.

252,Insurance engagement in flood risk reduction - examples from household and business insurance in developed countries,2018-01-01,"Insurance can be an important mechanism to stimulate flood risk reduction and thus decrease losses. However, there is a gap between the theoretical potential described by academic scholars and the actual engagement of insurers. In the analysis, I have collected examples of insurers' engagement in flood risk reduction, focusing on household and business insurance in developed countries. Insurers engaged either directly, e.g., through co-financing risk reduction, or more indirectly by giving incentives to policyholders or governmental actors to adopt risk reduction measures. I analyzed their engagement with the framing conditions of the market they were acting in, such as market penetration or private or public insurance schemes. I found risk reduction measures like awareness-raising campaigns targeting citizens to be quite common across several countries. There was less insurance engagement in risk reduction measures such as warning or land-use planning, which are perceived to be mainly governmental tasks. The use of risk-based pricing as an incentive for the adoption of risk reduction measures as suggested by academia is difficult in practice, due to barriers such as information gaps on the effectiveness of property-level protection measures and requirements concerning the affordability of insurance. New approaches to overcome these shortfalls include organized data collection on property-level protection measures or the insurance of high-risks for affordable premiums in public-private partnership constellations with the government.",220,insurance important mechanism stimulate flood risk reduction thus decrease loss however gap theoretical potential described academic scholar actual insurer analysis collected example insurer flood risk reduction focusing household business insurance developed country insurer engaged either directly e g co financing risk reduction indirectly giving incentive policyholder governmental actor adopt risk reduction measure analyzed framing condition market acting market penetration private insurance scheme found risk reduction measure like awareness raising campaign targeting citizen quite common across several country le insurance risk reduction measure warning land use planning perceived mainly governmental task use risk based pricing incentive adoption risk reduction measure suggested academia difficult practice due barrier information gap effectiveness property level protection measure requirement concerning affordability insurance approach overcome shortfall include organized data collection property level protection measure insurance high risk affordable premium private partnership constellation government
253,Who Should Pay for Climate Adaptation? Public Attitudes and the Financing of Flood Protection in Florida,2018-01-01,"An investigation of public support for coastal adaptation options and public finance options in Florida evaluated stakeholder judgments and how they changed through a participatory engagement process. The study found that public finance mechanisms that imposed fiscal burdens on those who directly benefit from hazard reduction were rated as more acceptable than others. Significantly, visualisations and data on local economic damage and return on investment of potential adaptation options further increased acceptability ratings. The question of whether a development fee for adaptation or any other public purpose supported by private funds is a legal issue that depends on a test called the rational nexus. One concern of this article is to explore options for such fees to cover adaptation to climate change. This raises issues about the potential conflict with the community-wide and intergenerational nature of long-term adaptation. We also explore the relevance of environmental attitudes using the 'new environmental paradigm' (NEP) scale and political party affiliation. Results have implications for infrastructure improvements that require public approval for financing.",169,investigation support coastal option finance option florida evaluated stakeholder judgment changed participatory process found finance mechanism imposed fiscal burden directly benefit hazard reduction rated acceptable others significantly visualisation data local economic damage return investment potential option increased acceptability rating question whether development fee purpose supported private fund legal issue depends test called rational nexus concern explore option fee cover raise issue potential conflict community wide intergenerational nature long term explore relevance environmental attitude environmental paradigm nep scale political party affiliation result implication infrastructure improvement require approval financing
254,Beyond Threshold Approaches to Extreme Heat: Repositioning Adaptation as Everyday Practice,2018-01-01,"One of climate change's most certain impacts is increasingly frequent and extreme heat. Heat management and climate adaptation policies generally utilize temperature and humidity thresholds to identify what constitute extreme conditions. In the workplace, such thresholds can be used to trigger reductions in work intensity and/or duration. In regions that routinely exceed proposed thresholds, however, this approach can be deeply problematic and raises critical questions about how frequently exposed populations already manage and mitigate the effects of extreme heat. Drawing on social practice theories, this paper repositions everyday engagements with extreme heat in terms of practices of work. It finds that bodies absorb and produce heat through practices, challenging the view that extreme heat is an external risk to which bodies are exposed. This theoretical starting point also challenges the utility of threshold-based adaptation strategies by demonstrating how heat is actively coproduced by living, performing bodies in weather. This argument is exemplified through a case study of outdoor, manual workers in Australia's monsoon tropics, where work practices were adapted to reduce thermal load. More specifically, we find that workers weather work and work the weather to enable work to be done in extreme conditions. Our analysis of everyday heat adaptation draws attention to the generative capacities of bodies and unsettles two established separations: 1) that between climatic exposure and sensitivity, calling for a more embodied, experiential, and performed perspective and 2) that between climatic impacts and (mal)adaptation, calling for an understanding of climate adaptation, as located in everyday practices, in the management of bodies in weather.",256,certain impact increasingly frequent extreme heat heat management policy generally utilize temperature humidity threshold identify constitute extreme condition workplace threshold used trigger reduction work intensity duration region routinely exceed proposed threshold however approach deeply problematic raise critical question frequently exposed population already manage mitigate effect extreme heat drawing social practice theory reposition everyday engagement extreme heat term practice work find body absorb produce heat practice challenging view extreme heat external risk body exposed theoretical starting point challenge utility threshold based strategy demonstrating heat actively coproduced living performing body weather argument exemplified outdoor manual worker australia monsoon tropic work practice adapted reduce thermal load specifically find worker weather work work weather enable work done extreme condition analysis everyday heat draw attention generative capacity body unsettles established separation climatic exposure sensitivity calling embodied experiential performed perspective climatic impact mal calling understanding located everyday practice management body weather
255,Typologies of citizen co-production in flood risk governance,2018-01-01,"Citizens in Europe are increasingly being encouraged by policymakers to contribute to flood risk governance (FRG) by taking individual and/or community-based flood risk measures (e.g. implementing property-level measures). This trend might be described as a transition towards 'co-produced' FRG between public authorities and citizens. The co-production trend is mirrored in literature, with an increasing number of publications discussing citizen involvement in the implementation of FRG. Still, this research is in its infancy and requires more systematic insight into the prevalence, success factors and side effects of co-produced FRG. This article contributes to this endeavour by looking across disciplinary boundaries to critically examine the extent to which co-production types identified in other policy domains match the diversity of co-production forms witnessed in FRG. Taking this co-production literature as a starting point, the authors assemble three typologies to capture the different forms of co-production witnessed in FRG. In order to do so, examples of FRG co-production were identified in England (UK), Flanders (Belgium), France, the Netherlands and Poland, through document analysis and in-depth interviews. These examples were used to test and redevelop co-production typologies described in literature. The resulting typologies concentrate on the i) type of interaction, ii) the role and type of citizen input and iii) the distribution of contributions and benefits. These frameworks have the potential to not only serve as important heuristic devices for future empirical research, but may also facilitate more reflexive governance in practice.",237,citizen europe increasingly encouraged policymakers contribute flood risk governance frg taking individual community based flood risk measure e g implementing property level measure trend might described transition towards co produced frg authority citizen co production trend mirrored literature increasing number publication discussing involvement implementation frg still research infancy requires systematic insight prevalence success factor side effect co produced frg contributes endeavour looking across disciplinary boundary critically examine extent co production type identified policy domain match diversity co production form witnessed frg taking co production literature starting point author assemble three typology capture different form co production witnessed frg order example frg co production identified england uk flanders belgium france netherlands poland document analysis depth interview example used test redevelop co production typology described literature resulting typology concentrate type interaction ii role type input iii distribution contribution benefit framework potential serve important heuristic device future empirical research may facilitate reflexive governance practice
256,UK public perceptions of Ocean Acidification - The importance of place and environmental identity,2018-01-01,"The marine environment is affected by climate change in many ways but it is also affected by the separate problem of ocean acidification (OA). Anthropogenic carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the ocean causes changes in ocean chemistry including an increase in acidity. Fisheries and shellfish industries, which are vital livelihoods for some communities have already been affected by OA. As there has been little research conducted to examine public risk perceptions of this issue, the aim was to explore this through a survey (N = 954) carried out in the UK. The survey explored a range of psychological factors including concern, place attachment, and environmental identity that are known to influence risk perceptions. A regression analysis found that more concerned participants had stronger environmental identities and higher levels of knowledge about OA. As predicted, they also felt more attached to the ocean and felt more negative about OA. It was clear that place attachment and environmental identity were important factors and thus should not be neglected when developing risk communications, particularly for this unfamiliar risk issue. As unfamiliar and complex risks such as OA are becoming more prevalent and must be communicated successfully in a world full of conflicting information, it is important to consider how OA is perceived by the public and how this can inform policy decisions in future. If major mitigation and adaptation strategies are adopted by policymakers the success of these will also ultimately require society to accept them.",244,marine environment affected many way affected separate problem ocean acidification oa anthropogenic carbon dioxide absorbed ocean cause change ocean chemistry including increase acidity fishery shellfish industry vital livelihood community already affected oa little research conducted examine risk perception issue aim explore survey n carried uk survey explored range psychological factor including concern place attachment environmental identity known influence risk perception regression analysis found concerned participant stronger environmental identity higher level knowledge oa predicted felt attached ocean felt negative oa clear place attachment environmental identity important factor thus neglected developing risk communication particularly unfamiliar risk issue unfamiliar complex risk oa becoming prevalent must communicated successfully world full conflicting information important consider oa perceived inform policy decision future major mitigation strategy adopted policymakers success ultimately require society accept
257,A discursive-institutional perspective on transformative governance: A case from a fire management policy sector,2018-01-01,"Scholarship around questions of climate change adaptation is increasingly concerned with ideas of transformative adaptation and its governance through critical re-evaluation of beliefs, values and associated institutions. For public policy sectors, the concept of transformative governance brings attention to their capacities for supporting and engaging in such governance. While much adaptation research and practice informs technical and structural understandings of these capacities (e.g., governance arrangements, learning systems and adaptation planning), most of this research (and practice) has ignored less formal, yet equally important dimensions of public administration and governance. Institutional scholarship highlights that dominant norms, beliefs, and philosophical ideas underpin how policy sectors structure their policy responses and engagement in governance. Discursive Institutionalism suggests that examining a sector's dominant discourse can provide insights into these institutional logics. This paper therefore argues that understanding a policy sector's institutional logics is a crucial part of working toward enabling transformative governance of adaptation. This argument is developed through a case study of the institutional logics operating in the fire management policy sector of Victoria, Australia, and the potential influence of these logics on that sector's capacities to engage in transformative governance. Findings suggest this sector's institutional logics may currently constrain its capacities to engage in transformative governance and highlight the need for greater attention to socioinstitutional dimensions of public administration to help catalyze transformative governance of (and for) adaptation.",226,scholarship around question increasingly concerned idea transformative governance critical evaluation belief value associated institution policy sector concept transformative governance brings attention capacity supporting engaging governance much research practice informs technical structural understanding capacity e g governance arrangement learning system planning research practice ignored le formal yet equally important dimension administration governance institutional scholarship highlight dominant norm belief philosophical idea underpin policy sector structure policy response governance discursive institutionalism suggests examining sector dominant discourse provide insight institutional logic therefore argues understanding policy sector institutional logic crucial part working toward enabling transformative governance argument developed institutional logic operating fire management policy sector victoria australia potential influence logic sector capacity engage transformative governance finding suggest sector institutional logic may currently constrain capacity engage transformative governance highlight need greater attention socioinstitutional dimension administration help catalyze transformative governance
